<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>The aim of the present book is twofold: to set forth the
leading phases of the historic socialism, and to attempt a
criticism and interpretation of the movement as a whole.
In this edition the changes in the history are concerned
chiefly with the revival of the International, which, since
the Stuttgart Congress in 1907, may be regarded as an
accomplished fact.</p>

<p>I have made it no part of my plan to dwell on details.
The interest and significance of the history of socialism
will be found, not in its details and accidents, but in
the development of its cardinal principles, which I have
endeavoured to trace. Readers desirous of detail must
be referred to the writings of the various socialists, or
to works that treat of special phases of the movement.
Yet I hope that the statement of the leading theories is
sufficiently clear and adequate to enable the reader to
form his own judgment of the highly controversial matters
involved in the history of socialism. I may add that in
every case my account is drawn from an extensive study
of the sources. These sources I have given both in the
text and in footnotes. For the more recent development
of the subject, however, the material is derived from such
a multitude of books, pamphlets, periodicals, and journals,
as well as from personal inquiry and observation, that it
has not been found practicable to indicate them.</p>

<p>But the purely historical part of such a work is far
from being the most difficult. The real difficulty begins
when we attempt to form a clear conception of the meaning
and significance of the socialistic movement, to indicate
<span class='pageno' title='vi' id='Page_vi'></span>
its place in history, and the issues to which it is
tending. In the concluding chapters I have made such
an attempt. The good reader who takes the trouble to
go so far through my book can accept my contribution to
a hard problem for what it is worth. He may at least
feel assured that it is no hasty and ill-considered effort
which is placed before him. The present volume grew
out of the articles on socialism published in the ninth
edition of the <span class='it'>Encyclopædia Britannica</span>. The views advocated
there were first set forth in my <span class='it'>Inquiry into Socialism</span>,
published in 1887. In this edition of the <span class='it'>History</span> they
have in some points received such expansion and modification
as time and repeated, self-criticism have suggested.
I beg particularly to invite the attention of the reader to
the last two chapters, in which the present position of
socialism and its relation to some contemporary questions,
such as those of Empire, are set forth.</p>

<p>To all thoughtful and discerning men it should now
be clear that the solution of the social question is the
great task which has been laid upon the present epoch in
the history of the world. Socialism grew to be a very
important question during the nineteenth century; in
all probability it will be the supreme question of the
twentieth. No higher felicity can befall any man than
to have thrown a real light on the greatest problem of
his time; and to have utterly failed is no disgrace. In
such a cause it is an honour even to have done efficient
work as a navvy or hodman.</p>

<p>For help with the notes on the recent progress of
socialism I wish to express special obligations to Mr.
H. W. Lee, secretary of the Social Democratic Party,
to Mr. J. R. Macdonald, M.P., secretary of the Labour
Party, and to Mr. E. R. Pease, secretary of the Fabian
Society.</p>

<div><h1>A HISTORY OF SOCIALISM</h1></div>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>Though much has been said and written about socialism
for many years, it still remains a questionable name
which awakens in the mind of the reader doubt, perplexity,
and contradiction.</p>

<p>But there can be no question that it is a growing
power throughout the world. It is hardly an exaggeration
to say that the most intelligent and the best
organised working-men of all civilised countries are
passing over to it. The opinions which are being
accepted by the foremost of the working-classes to-day
will in all probability have the same attraction for
their less advanced brethren to-morrow. It is a subject,
however, which concerns all classes, and it is
forcing to the front a wide group of problems which
are every day becoming more urgent.</p>

<p>In view of this there is only one right and safe course;
we should seek to know the truth about socialism.
The discontent which tends to disturbance and revolution
can be removed only by satisfying the legitimate
needs and aspirations of those who suffer.
<span class='pageno' title='2' id='Page_2'></span></p>

<p>We all know that the propaganda of socialism has
been attended with intemperate and violent language,
with wild opinions which are often inconsistent with
the first principles of social order, with revolutionary
outbreaks leading to bloodshed, desolation and long-continued
unrest and suspicion. These things are greatly
to be deplored. But we shall be wise if we regard them
as symptoms of wide-spread and deep-seated social
disease. The best way to cure such disease is to study
and remove the causes of it. No physician will have
any success in combating a malady if he content himself
with suppressing its symptoms.</p>

<p>For the study of socialism two things are essential
on the part of the reader—good-will and the open
mind. Socialism has at least a most powerful provisional
claim on our good-will, that it professes to
represent the cause of the sufferers in the world’s long
agony, of the working-classes, of women, and of the
down-trodden nations and races. If it can make any
solid contribution in such a far-reaching cause it has
the strongest right to be heard.</p>

<p>Need we say that no new movement like socialism
can be understood or appreciated without some measure
of the open mind? In the course of history it has
been proved over and over again that established ideas
and institutions are not always in the right in every
respect, and that novel opinions, though presented in
extravagant and intemperate language, are not always
entirely wrong. Even the most prejudiced reader will
do well to consider that a cause which now numbers
<span class='pageno' title='3' id='Page_3'></span>
millions of intelligent adherents, for which men have
died and gladly suffered imprisonment and privation of
every kind, may contain elements of truth and of well-justified
hope for the future.</p>

<p>Above all things, it is essential to remember that
socialism is not a stereotyped system of dogma. It is
a movement which springs out of a vast and only
partially shapen reality. It is therefore living and
liable to change. It has a history on which we can
look back; but it is above all things a force of the
present and the future, and its influence in the future
for good or evil will depend on how we the men of the
present relate ourselves to it.</p>

<p>On the one hand, it would be a great wrong if we
encouraged vain and delusive expectations; but it would
be a wrong even greater, on the other hand, if from
whim or prejudice or pessimism we did anything that
might be an obstacle to truth and progress. In a subject
so momentous the only right course is to eschew
passion and prejudice, and to follow truth with goodwill
and an open mind.</p>

<p>The word ‘socialism’ appears to have been first
used in <span class='it'>The Poor Man’s Guardian</span> in 1833. In
1835, a society, which received the grandiloquent
name of the Association of all Classes of all Nations,
was founded under the auspices of Robert Owen; and
the words socialist and socialism became current during
the discussions which arose in connection with it.<a id='r1_1'/><a href='#f1_1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a> As
Owen and his school had no esteem for the political
<span class='pageno' title='4' id='Page_4'></span>
reform of the time, and laid all emphasis on the necessity
of social improvement and reconstruction, it is
obvious how the name came to be recognised as suitable
and distinctive. The term was soon afterwards
borrowed from England, as he himself tells us, by a
distinguished French writer, Reybaud, in his well-known
work the <span class='it'>Réformateurs modernes</span>, in which he
discussed the theories of Saint-Simon, Fourier, and
Owen. Through Reybaud it soon gained wide currency
on the Continent, and is now the accepted
world-historic name for one of the most remarkable
movements of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>The name was thus first applied in England to
Owen’s theory of social reconstruction, and in France
to those also of Saint-Simon and Fourier. The best
usage has always connected it with the views of these
men, and with the cognate opinions which have since
appeared. But the word is used with a great variety
of meaning, not only in popular speech and by politicians,
but even by economists and learned critics of
socialism. There is a growing tendency to regard as
socialistic any interference with property undertaken
by society on behalf of the poor, the limitation of the
principle of <span class='it'>laissez-faire</span> in favour of the suffering
classes, radical social reform which disturbs the present
system of private property as regulated by free competition.
It is probable enough that the word will be
permanently used to express the change in practice
and opinion indicated by these phrases, as a general
name for the strong reaction that has now set in
<span class='pageno' title='5' id='Page_5'></span>
against the overstrained individualism and one-sided
freedom which date from the end of the eighteenth
century. The application is neither precise nor accurate;
but it is use and wont that determine the meaning
of words, and this seems to be the tendency of use
and wont.</p>

<p>Even economic writers differ greatly in the meaning
they attach to the word. As socialism has been most
powerful and most studied on the Continent, it may be
interesting to compare the definitions given by some
leading French and German economists. The great
German economist Roscher defines it as including
‘those tendencies which demand a greater regard for
the common weal than consists with human nature.’<a id='r2_1'/><a href='#f2_1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a>
Adolf Held says that ‘we may define as socialistic
every tendency which demands the subordination of
the individual will to the community.’<a id='r3_1'/><a href='#f3_1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a> Janet more
precisely defines it as follows: ‘We call socialism
every doctrine which teaches that the State has a right
to correct the inequality of wealth which exists among
men, and to legally establish the balance by taking
from those who have too much in order to give to
those who have not enough, and that in a permanent
manner, and not in such and such a particular case—a
famine, for instance, a public calamity, etc.’<a id='r4_1'/><a href='#f4_1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[4]</span></sup></a> Laveleye
explains it thus: ‘In the first place, every socialistic
doctrine aims at introducing greater equality in
<span class='pageno' title='6' id='Page_6'></span>
social conditions; and in the second place, at realising
those reforms by the law or the State.’<a id='r5_1'/><a href='#f5_1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[5]</span></sup></a> Von Scheel
simply defines it as the ‘economic philosophy of the
suffering classes.’<a id='r6_1'/><a href='#f6_1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[6]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>Of all these definitions it can only be said that they
more or less faithfully reflect current opinion as to the
nature of socialism. They are either too vague or they
are misleading, and they quite fail to bring out the clear
and strongly marked characteristics that distinguish the
phenomena to which the name of socialism is properly
applied. To say that socialism exacts a greater regard
for the common weal than is compatible with human
nature is to pass sentence on the movement, not to
define it. In all ages of the world, and under all forms
and tendencies of government and of social evolution,
the will of the individual has been subordinated to the
will of society, often unduly so.</p>

<p>It is also most misleading to speak as if socialism
must proceed from the State as we know it. The early
socialism proceeded from private effort and experiment.
A great deal of the most notorious socialism of the
present day aims not only at subverting the existing
State in every form, but all the existing political and
social institutions. The most powerful and most philosophic,
that of Karl Marx, aimed at superseding the
existing Governments by a vast international combination
of the workers of all nations, without distinction of
creed, colour, or nationality.</p>

<p><span class='pageno' title='7' id='Page_7'></span></p>

<p>Still more objectionable, however, is the tendency not
unfrequently shown to identify socialism with a violent
and lawless revolutionary spirit. As sometimes used,
‘socialism’ means nothing more nor less than the most
modern form of the revolutionary spirit with a suggestion
of anarchy and dynamite. This is to confound the
essence of the movement with an accidental feature
more or less common to all great innovations. Every
new thing of any moment, whether good or evil, has its
revolutionary stage, in which it disturbs and upsets the
accepted beliefs and institutions. The Protestant
Reformation was for more than a century and a half the
occasion of civil and international trouble and bloodshed.
The suppression of American slavery could not
be effected without a tremendous civil war. There was
a time when the opinions comprehended under the
name of ‘liberalism’ had to fight to the death for toleration;
and representative government was at one time
a revolutionary innovation. The fact that a movement
is revolutionary generally implies only that it is new,
that it is disposed to exert itself by strong methods,
and is calculated to make great changes. It is an
unhappy feature of most great changes that they have
been attended with the exercise of force, but that is because
the powers in possession have generally attempted
to suppress them by the exercise of force.</p>

<p>In point of fact socialism is one of the most elastic
and protean phenomena of history, varying according
to the time and circumstances in which it appears, and
with the character and opinions and institutions of the
<span class='pageno' title='8' id='Page_8'></span>
people who adopt it. Such a movement cannot be
condemned or approved <span class='it'>en bloc</span>. Most of the current
formulæ to which it has been referred for praise or
censure are totally erroneous and misleading. Yet in
the midst of the various theories that go by the name
of ‘socialism’ there is a kernel of principle that is
common to them all. That principle is of an economic
nature, and is most clear and precise.</p>

<p>The central aim of socialism is to terminate the divorce
of the workers from the natural sources of subsistence
and of culture. The socialist theory is based on the
historical assertion that the course of social evolution
for centuries has gradually been to exclude the producing
classes from the possession of land and capital, and
to establish a new subjection, the subjection of workers
who have nothing to depend on but precarious wage-labour.
Socialists maintain that the present system
(in which land and capital are the property of private
individuals freely struggling for increase of wealth)
leads inevitably to social and economic anarchy, to the
degradation of the working man and his family, to the
growth of vice and idleness among the wealthy classes
and their dependants, to bad and inartistic workmanship,
to insecurity, waste, and starvation; and that it is
tending more and more to separate society into two
classes, wealthy millionaires confronted with an enormous
mass of proletarians, the issue out of which must
either be socialism or social ruin. To avoid all these
evils and to secure a more equitable distribution of the
means and appliances of happiness, socialists propose
<span class='pageno' title='9' id='Page_9'></span>
that land and capital, which are the requisites of labour
and the sources of all wealth and culture, should be
placed under social ownership and control.</p>

<p>In thus maintaining that society should assume the
management of industry and secure an equitable distribution
of its fruits, socialists are agreed; but on the
most important points of detail they differ very greatly.
They differ as to the form society will take in carrying
out the socialist programme, as to the relation of local
bodies to the central government, and whether there is
to be any central government, or any government at all
in the ordinary sense of the word; as to the influence of
the national idea in the society of the future, etc. They
differ also as to what should be regarded as an ‘equitable’
system of distribution. The school of Saint-Simon
advocated a social hierarchy, in which every man should
be placed according to his capacity and rewarded
according to his works. In the communities of Fourier
the minimum of subsistence was to be guaranteed to
each out of the common gain, the remainder to be
divided between labour, capital, and talent—five-twelfths
going to the first, four-twelfths to the second
and three-twelfths to the third. At the revolution of
1848 Louis Blanc proposed that remuneration should be
equal for all members of his <span class='it'>social workshops</span>. In the
programme drawn up by the united Social Democrats of
Germany (Gotha, 1875) it was provided that all shall
enjoy the results of labour according to their reasonable
wants, all of course being bound to work.</p>

<p>It is needless to say also that the theories of socialism
<span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'></span>
have been held in connection with the most varying
opinions in philosophy and religion. A great deal of
the historic socialism has been regarded as a necessary
implicate of idealism. The prevailing socialism of the
day is in large part based on the frankest and most outspoken
revolutionary materialism. On the other hand,
many socialists hold that their system is a necessary outcome
of Christianity, that socialism and Christianity are
essential the one to the other; and it should be said
that the ethics of socialism are closely akin to the ethics
of Christianity, if not identical with them.</p>

<p>Still, it should be insisted that the basis of socialism
is economic, involving a fundamental change in the
relation of labour to land and capital—a change which
will largely affect production, and will entirely revolutionise
the existing system of distribution. But, while
its basis is economic, socialism implies and carries with
it a change in the political, ethical, technical, and
artistic arrangements and institutions of society, which
would constitute a revolution greater than has ever
taken place in human history, greater than the transition
from the ancient to the mediæval world, or from
the latter to the existing order of society.</p>

<p>In the first place, such a change generally assumes
as its political complement the most thoroughly democratic
organisation of society. The early socialism of
Owen and Saint-Simon was marked by not a little of
the autocratic spirit; but the tendency of the present
socialism is more and more to ally itself with the most
advanced democracy. Socialism, in fact, claims to be
<span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'></span>
the economic complement of democracy, maintaining
that without a fundamental economic change political
privilege has neither meaning nor value.</p>

<p>In the second place, socialism naturally goes with
an unselfish or altruistic system of ethics. The most
characteristic feature of the old societies was the exploitation
of the weak by the strong under the systems
of slavery, serfdom, and wage-labour. Under the
socialistic <span class='it'>régime</span> it is the privilege and duty of the
strong and talented to use their superior force and richer
endowments in the service of their fellow-men without
distinction of class, or nation, or creed. Whatever our
opinion may be of the wisdom or practicability of their
theories, history proves that socialists have been ready
to sacrifice wealth, social position, and life itself, for the
cause which they have adopted.</p>

<p>In the third place, socialists maintain that, under
their system and no other, can the highest excellence
and beauty be realised in industrial production and in
art; whereas under the present system beauty and
thoroughness are alike sacrificed to cheapness, which is
a necessity of successful competition.</p>

<p>Lastly, the socialists refuse to admit that individual
happiness or freedom or character would be sacrificed
under the social arrangements they propose. They
believe that under the present system a free and harmonious
development of individual capacity and happiness
is possible only for the privileged minority, and
that socialism alone can open up a fair opportunity for
all. They believe, in short, that there is no opposition
<span class='pageno' title='12' id='Page_12'></span>
whatever between socialism and individuality rightly
understood, that these two are complements the one of
the other, that in socialism alone may every individual
have hope of free development and a full realisation of
himself.</p>

<p>Having shown how wide a social revolution is implied
in the socialistic scheme of reconstruction, we may now
state (1) that the economic basis of the prevalent
socialism is a collectivism which excludes private possession
of land and capital, and places them under social
ownership in some form or other. In the words of
Schäffle, ‘the Alpha and Omega of socialism is the transformation
of private competing capital into a united
collective capital.’<a id='r7_1'/><a href='#f7_1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[7]</span></sup></a> Adolf Wagner’s more elaborate
definition of it<a id='r8_1'/><a href='#f8_1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[8]</span></sup></a> is entirely in agreement with that of
Schäffle. Such a system, while insisting on collective
capital, is quite consistent with private property in other
forms, and with perfect freedom in the use of one’s own
share in the equitable distribution of the produce of the
associated labour. A thorough-going socialism demands
that this principle should be applied to the capital and
production of the whole world; only then can it attain
to supreme and perfect realisation. But a sober-minded
socialism will admit that the various intermediate
stages in which the principle finds a partial application
are so far a true and real development of the socialistic
idea.</p>

<p>Even the best definitions, however, are only of
<span class='pageno' title='13' id='Page_13'></span>
secondary importance; and while we believe that those
we have just mentioned give an accurate account of the
prevailing socialism, they are arbitrary, abstract, and
otherwise open to objection. As we have already seen,
the system of Fourier admitted of private capital under
social control. The absolute views of the subject now
current are due to the excessive love of system characteristic
of German thought, and are not consistent either
with history or human nature.</p>

<p>(2) Socialism is both a theory of social evolution and
a working force in the history of the nineteenth century.
The teaching of some eminent socialists, such as Rodbertus,
may be regarded as a prophecy concerning the
social development of the future rather than as a subject
of agitation. In their view socialism is the next stage
in the evolution of society, destined after many generations
to supersede capitalism, as capitalism displaced
feudalism, and feudalism succeeded to slavery. Even
the majority of the most active socialists consider the
question as still in the stage of agitation and propaganda,
their present task being that of enlightening the masses
until the consummation of the present social development,
and the declared bankruptcy of the present social
order, shall have delivered the world into their hands.
Socialism, therefore, is for the most part a theory affecting
the future, more or less remote, and has only to a
limited degree gained a real and practical footing in the
life of our time. Yet it should not be forgotten that its
doctrines have most powerfully affected all the ablest
recent economic writers of Germany, and have even considerably
<span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span>
modified German legislation. Its influence is
rapidly growing among the lower and also among the
most advanced classes in almost every country dominated
by European culture, following the development of
capitalism, of which it is not merely the negation, but
in a far wider and more real sense is also the goal.</p>

<p>(3) In its doctrinal aspects socialism is most interesting
as a criticism of the present economic order, of
what socialists call the capitalistic system, with which
the existing land system is connected. Under the
present economic order land and capital (the material
and instruments without which industry is impossible)
are the property of a class employing a class of wage-labourers
handicapped by their exclusion from land and
capital. Competition is the general rule by which the
share of the members of those classes in the fruits of
production is determined. Against this system critical
socialism is a reasoned protest; and it is at issue also
with the prevailing political economy, in so far as it
assumes or maintains the permanence or righteousness
of this economic order. Of the economic optimism
implied in the historic doctrine of <span class='it'>laissez-faire</span>, socialism
is an uncompromising rejection.</p>

<p>(4) Socialism is usually regarded as a phase of the
struggle for the emancipation of labour, for the complete
participation of the working classes in the material,
intellectual, and spiritual inheritance of the human
race. This is certainly the most substantial and most
prominent part of the socialist programme, the working
classes being the most numerous and the worst sufferers
<span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span>
from the present <span class='it'>régime</span>. This view, however, is rather
one-sided, for socialism claims not less to be in the
interest of the small capitalist gradually crushed by the
competition of the larger, and in the interest also of the
large capitalist, whose position is endangered by the
vastness and unwieldiness of his success, and by the
world-wide economic anarchy from which even the
greatest are not secure. Still, it is the deliverance of
the working class that stands in the front of every
socialistic theory; and, though the initiative in socialist
speculation and action has usually come from men
belonging to the middle and upper classes, yet it is to
the workmen that they generally appeal.</p>

<p>While recognising the great confusion in the use of
the word ‘socialism,’ we have treated it as properly a
phenomenon of the nineteenth century, beginning in
France with Saint-Simon and Fourier, in England with
Robert Owen, and most powerfully represented at the
present day by the school of Karl Marx. As we have
seen, however, there are definitions of the word which
would give it a wider range of meaning and a more
ancient beginning, compared with which capitalism is
but of yesterday; which would, in fact, make it as old
as human society itself. In the early stages of human
development, when the tribe or the village community
was the social unit, the subordination of the individual
to the society in which he dwelt was the rule, and
common property was the prevalent form. In the
development of the idea of property, especially as
regards land, three successive historical stages are
<span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span>
broadly recognised—common property and common
enjoyment of it, common property and private enjoyment,
private property and private enjoyment.
The last form did not attain to full expression till the
end of the eighteenth century, when the principle of
individual freedom, which was really a reaction against
privileged restriction, was proclaimed as a positive
axiom of government and of economics. The free
individual struggle for wealth, and for the social advantages
dependent on wealth, is a comparatively
recent thing.</p>

<p>At all periods of history the State has reserved to
itself the right to interpose in the arrangements of
property—sometimes in favour of the poor, as in the
case of the English poor law, which may thus be regarded
as a socialistic measure. Moreover, all through
history revolts in favour of the rearrangement of
property have been very frequent. From the beginning
there have existed misery and discontent, the contemplation
of which has called forth schemes of an
ideal society in the noblest and most sympathetic
minds. Of these are the Utopias of Plato and Thomas
More, advocating a systematic communism. And in
the societies of the Catholic Church we have a permanent
example of common property and a common
enjoyment of it.</p>

<p>How are we to distinguish the socialism of the nineteenth
century from these old-world phenomena, and
especially from the communism which has played so
great a part in history? To this query it is not difficult
<span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span>
to give a clear and precise answer from the socialist
point of view. Socialism is a stage in the evolution
of society which could not arrive till the conditions
necessary to it had been established. Of these, one
most essential condition was the development of the great
industrialism which, after a long period of preparation
and gradual growth, began to reach its culminating point
with the inventions and technical improvements, with
the application of steam and the rise of the factory
system, in England towards the end of the eighteenth
century. Under this system industry was organised
into a vast social operation, and was thus already so
far socialised; but it was a system that was exploited
by the individual owner of the capital at his own
pleasure and for his own behoof. Under the pressure
of the competition of the large industry, the small
capitalist is gradually crushed out, and the working
producers become wage-labourers organised and drilled
in immense factories and workshops. The development
of this system still continues, and is enveloping
the whole world. Such is the industrial revolution.</p>

<p>Parallel with this a revolution in the world of ideas,
equally great and equally necessary to the rise of
socialism, has taken place. This change of thought,
which made its world-historic announcement in the
French Revolution, made reason the supreme judge,
and had freedom for its great practical watchword. It
was represented in the economic sphere by the school
of Adam Smith. Socialism was an outcome of it too,
and first of all in Saint-Simon and his school professed
<span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span>
to give the positive and constructive corrective to a
negative movement which did not see that it was
merely negative and therefore temporary. In other
words, Saint-Simon may be said to aim at nothing less
than the completion of the work of Voltaire, Rousseau,
and Adam Smith.</p>

<p>Thus socialism professes to be the legitimate child
of two great revolutions,—of the industrial revolution
which began to establish itself in England towards the
end of the eighteenth century, and of the parallel revolution
in thought which about the same time found
most prominent expression in France. Robert Owen
worked chiefly under the influence of the former;
Saint-Simon and Fourier grew up under the latter.
The conspiracy of Babeuf, which took place in 1796,
shortly after the French Revolution, is properly to be
regarded as a crude revolutionary communism not
essentially different from the rude efforts in communism
made in earlier periods of history. With Saint-Simon
and Owen historic socialism really begins, and is no
longer an isolated fact, but has had a continuous and
widening development, the succession of socialistic
teaching and propaganda being taken up by one country
after another throughout the civilised world.</p>

<p>We have seen, then, that the rise of socialism as a
new and reasoned theory of society was relative to the
industrial revolution and to the ideas proclaimed in the
French Revolution, prominent among which, besides the
much emphasised idea of freedom and the less easily
realised ideals of equality and fraternity, was the conception
<span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span>
of the worth and dignity of labour. Though
Owen was most largely influenced by the former and
Saint-Simon and Fourier by the latter, it is certain that
all three were greatly affected by both the new movements.
The motive power in Owen’s career was the
philanthropy and humanitarianism of the eighteenth
century. He had grown up in the midst of the industrial
revolution; he was one of the most successful
pioneers in the improvement of the cotton manufacture.
No one could be more deeply conscious of the enormous
abuses of the factory system; and no one better knew
the wonderful services that might be rendered by
technical improvement if only it were made subordinate
to human well-being. In the career of Owen we see
the new spirit of the eighteenth century seeking to
bring the mechanism of the new industrial system
under the direction of a nobler principle, in which the
good of all should be the great and sole aim.</p>

<p>The position of Saint-Simon was considerably different,
yet akin. As Owen had before his eyes the evils
of a young but gigantic industrialism, Saint-Simon
contemplated the hoary abuses of an idle and privileged
feudalism, fearfully shaken no doubt by the Revolution,
but still strong in Europe, and in France, as elsewhere,
powerfully revived during the period after Waterloo.
Saint-Simon saw that a new world, an industrial world
resting on labour, had arisen, while the old feudal and
theological world—<span class='it'>fainéant</span> courtiers and a clergy
steeped in ignorance—still ruled. All this array of
parasites, who had no longer any useful function to
<span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span>
perform for society, Saint-Simon sought to replace by
the industrial chiefs and scientific leaders as the real
working heads of the French people. Only, he expected
that these exceptionally gifted men, instead of
exploiting the labour of others, should control an industrial
France for the general good.</p>

<p>Neither Owen nor Saint-Simon was revolutionary
in the ordinary sense. Owen was most anxious that
the English and other Governments should adopt his
projects of socialistic reform. Leading statesmen and
royal personages befriended him. He had no faith in
the political reforms of 1832; he reckoned the political
side of chartism as of no account, and he preferred
socialistic experiment under autocratic guidance until
the workmen should be trained to rule themselves.
The same autocratic tendency was very pronounced in
Saint-Simon and his school. His first appeal was to
Louis XVIII. He wished to supersede the feudal aristocracy
by a working aristocracy of merit. His school
claim to have been the first to warn the Governments
of Europe of the rise of revolutionary socialism. In
short, the early socialism arose during the reaction consequent
on the wars of the French Revolution, and was
influenced by the political tendencies of the time.</p>

<p>The beginning of socialism may be dated from 1817,
the year when Owen laid his scheme for a socialistic
community before the committee of the House of Commons
on the poor law, the year also that the speculations
of Saint-Simon definitely took a socialistic
direction. The outlines of the history of socialism are
<span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span>
very simple. Till 1850 there was a double movement
in France and England. In the former country, after
Saint-Simon and Fourier the movement was represented
chiefly by Proudhon and Louis Blanc. In England,
after Owen the movement was taken up by the body
of Christian socialists associated with Maurice and
Kingsley.</p>

<p>During the next stage in the development of
socialism we see the influence chiefly of German
and also Russian thinkers, but it is generally international
both in its principles and sympathies. The
prevalent socialism found its first expression in the
manifesto of the Communist Party published in 1848.
The same views were elaborated by Marx in his
<span class='it'>Kapital</span> (1867), and have in later times been consolidated
and modified by many writers in many lands,
in the programmes of national parties and in the
resolutions of international congresses.</p>

<p>In this Introduction we have tried to give a preliminary
conception of our subject, and we shall now
proceed to present the leading views of the men who
have taken the chief part in originating and guiding
the socialist movement.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br/><br/>EARLY FRENCH SOCIALISM</h2>

<h3><span class='it'>SAINT-SIMON</span></h3>

<p>The founders of the early socialism grew up under the
influence of the too-confident optimism which characterised
the early stages of the French Revolution of
1789. They had an excessive faith in the possibilities
of human progress and perfectibility; they knew little
of the true laws of social evolution—in fact, did not
sufficiently recognise those aspects of life which Darwinism
has brought out so clearly. These faults the
early socialists shared with many other thinkers of the
time in which they lived.</p>

<p>Comte Henri de Saint-Simon, the founder of French
socialism, was born at Paris in 1760. He belonged to
a younger branch of the family of the celebrated duke
of that name. His education, he tells us, was directed
by d’Alembert. At the age of nineteen he went as
volunteer to assist the American colonies in their
revolt against Britain.</p>

<p>From his youth Saint-Simon felt the promptings of
an eager ambition. His valet had orders to awake him
<span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span>
every morning with the words, ‘Remember, monsieur
le comte, that you have great things to do’; and his
ancestor Charlemagne appeared to him in a dream, foretelling
a remarkable future for him. Among his early
schemes was one to unite the Atlantic and the Pacific
by a canal, and another to construct a canal from
Madrid to the sea.</p>

<p>He took no part of any importance in the French
Revolution, but amassed a little fortune by land speculation—not
on his own account, however, as he said,
but to facilitate his future projects. Accordingly, when
he was nearly forty years of age he went through a
varied course of study and experiment, in order to
enlarge and clarify his view of things. One of these
experiments was an unhappy marriage, which after a
year’s duration was dissolved by the mutual consent of
the parties. Another result of his experiments was
that he found himself completely impoverished, and
lived in penury for the remainder of his life.</p>

<p>The first of his numerous writings, <span class='it'>Lettres d’un
Habitant de Genève</span>, appeared in 1803; but his early
works were mostly scientific and political. It was
not till 1817 that he began, in a treatise entitled
<span class='it'>L’Industrie</span>, to propound his socialistic views, which he
further developed in <span class='it'>L’Organisateur</span> (1819), <span class='it'>Du Système
industrial</span> (1821), <span class='it'>Catéchisme des Industriels</span> (1823).
The last and most important expression of his views is
the <span class='it'>Nouveau Christianisme</span> (1825).</p>

<p>For many years before his death in 1825 Saint-Simon
had been reduced to the greatest straits. He was
<span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span>
obliged to accept a laborious post for a salary of £40 a
year, to live on the generosity of a former valet, and
finally to solicit a small pension from his family. In
1823 he attempted suicide in despair. It was not till
very late in his career that he attached to himself a few
ardent disciples.</p>

<p>As a thinker Saint-Simon was entirely deficient in
system, clearness, and consecutive strength. His writings
are largely made up of a few ideas continually
repeated. But his speculations are always ingenious
and original; and he has unquestionably exercised
great influence on modern thought, both as the historic
founder of French socialism and as suggesting much of
what was afterwards elaborated into Comtism.</p>

<p>Apart from the details of his socialistic teaching,
with which we need not concern ourselves, we find that
the ideas of Saint-Simon with regard to the reconstruction
of society are very simple. His opinions
were conditioned by the French Revolution and by the
feudal and military system still prevalent in France.
In opposition to the destructive liberalism of the
Revolution he insisted on the necessity of a new and
positive reorganisation of society. So far was he from
advocating social revolt that he appealed to Louis
XVIII. to inaugurate the new order of things. In
opposition, however, to the feudal and military system,
the former aspect of which had been strengthened by
the Restoration, he advocated an arrangement by which
the industrial chiefs should control society. In place
of the Mediæval Church, the spiritual direction of
<span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span>
society should fall to the men of science. What Saint-Simon
desired, therefore, was an industrialist State
directed by modern science. The men who are best
fitted to organise society for productive labour are entitled
to bear rule in it.</p>

<p>The social aim is to produce things useful to life;
the final end of social activity is ‘the exploitation of
the globe by association.’ The contrast between labour
and capital, so much emphasised by later socialism, is
not present to Saint-Simon, but it is assumed that the
industrial chiefs, to whom the control of production is
to be committed, shall rule in the interest of society.
Later on, the cause of the poor receives greater attention,
till in his greatest work, <span class='it'>The New Christianity</span>, it
becomes the central point of his teaching, and takes the
form of a religion. It was this religious development
of his teaching that occasioned his final quarrel with
Comte.</p>

<p>Previous to the publication of the <span class='it'>Nouveau Christianisme</span>
Saint-Simon had not concerned himself with
theology. Here he starts from a belief in God, and his
object in the treatise is to reduce Christianity to its
simple and essential elements. He does this by clearing
it of the dogmas and other excrescences and defects
that have gathered round both the Catholic and Protestant
forms of it, which he subjects to a searching and
ingenious criticism. The moral doctrine will by the
new faith be considered the most important; the divine
element in Christianity is contained in the precept that
men should act towards one another as brethren. ‘The
<span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span>
new Christian organisation will deduce the temporal
institutions as well as the spiritual from the principle
that all men should act towards one another as brethren.’
Expressing the same idea in modern language, Saint-Simon
propounds as the comprehensive formula of the
new Christianity this precept: ‘The whole of society
ought to strive towards the amelioration of the moral
and physical existence of the poorest class; society
ought to organise itself in the way best adapted for
attaining this end.’ This principle became the watchword
of the entire school of Saint-Simon; for them it
was alike the essence of religion and the programme
of social reform.</p>

<p>During his lifetime the views of Saint-Simon had
little influence, and he left only a very few devoted
disciples, who continued to advocate the doctrines of
their master, whom they revered as a prophet. An
important departure was made in 1828 by Bazard, who
gave a ‘complete exposition of the Saint-Simonian
faith’ in a long course of lectures in the Rue Taranne
at Paris. In 1830 Bazard and Enfantin were acknowledged
as the heads of the school; and the fermentation
caused by the revolution of July of the same year
brought the whole movement prominently before the
attention of France. Early next year the school obtained
possession of the <span class='it'>Globe</span> through Pierre Leroux,
who had joined the party, which now numbered some
of the ablest and most promising young men of France,
many of the pupils of the École Polytechnique having
caught its enthusiasm. The members formed themselves
<span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span>
into an association arranged in three grades, and
constituting a society or family, which lived out of a
common purse in the Rue Monsigny.</p>

<p>Before long, however, dissensions began to arise in
the sect. Bazard, a man of logical and more solid
temperament, could no longer work in harmony with
Enfantin, who desired to establish an arrogant and
fantastic sacerdotalism, with lax notions as to marriage
and the relations of the sexes. After a time Bazard
seceded, and many of the strongest supporters followed
his example. A series of extravagant entertainments
given by the society during the winter of 1832 reduced
its financial resources and greatly discredited it in
character. They finally removed to Menilmontant, to
a property of Enfantin, where they lived in a communistic
society, distinguished by a peculiar dress.
Shortly afterwards the chiefs were tried and condemned
for proceedings prejudicial to the social order; and the
sect was entirely broken up in 1832. Many of its
members became famous as engineers, economists, and
men of business. The idea of constructing the Suez
Canal, as carried out by Lesseps, proceeded from the
school.</p>

<p>In the school of Saint-Simon we find a great advance
both in the breadth and firmness with which the vague
and confused views of the master are developed; and
this progress is due chiefly to Bazard. In the philosophy
of history they recognise epochs of two kinds,
the critical or negative, and the organic or constructive.
The former, in which philosophy is the dominating
<span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span>
force, is characterised by war, egotism, and anarchy;
the latter, which is controlled by religion, is marked by
the spirit of obedience, devotion, association. The two
spirits of antagonism and association are the two great
social principles, and on the degree of prevalence of the
two depends the character of an epoch. The spirit of
association, however, tends more and more to prevail
over its opponent, extending from the family to the
city, from the city to the nation, and from the nation
to the federation. This principle of association is to be
the keynote of the social development of the future.
Hitherto the law of humanity has been the ‘exploitation
of man by man’ in its three stages—slavery,
serfdom, the proletariat; in the future the aim must be
‘the exploitation of the globe by man associated to
man.’</p>

<p>Under the present system the industrial chief still
exploits the proletariat, the members of which, though
nominally free, must accept his terms under pain of
starvation. This state of things is consolidated by the
law of inheritance, whereby the instruments of production,
which are private property, and all the attendant
social advantages, are transmitted without regard to
personal merit. The social disadvantages being also
transmitted, misery becomes hereditary. The only
remedy for this is the abolition of the law of inheritance,
and the union of all the instruments of labour in
a social fund, which shall be exploited by association.
Society thus becomes sole proprietor, entrusting to
social groups or social functionaries the management of
<span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span>
the various properties. The right of succession is
transferred from the family to the State.</p>

<p>The school of Saint-Simon insists strongly on the
claims of merit; they advocate a social hierarchy in
which each man shall be placed according to his
capacity and rewarded according to his works. This
is, indeed, a most special and pronounced feature of
the Saint-Simon Socialism, whose theory of government
is a kind of spiritual or scientific autocracy,
culminating in the fantastic sacerdotalism of Enfantin.</p>

<p>With regard to the family and the relation of the
sexes, the school of Saint-Simon advocated the complete
emancipation of woman and her entire equality with
man. The ‘social individual’ is man and woman, who
are associated in the triple function of religion, the
State, and the family. In its official declarations the
school maintained the sanctity of the Christian law of
marriage. On this point Enfantin fell into a prurient
and fantastic latitudinarianism, which made the school
a scandal to France, but many of the most prominent
members besides Bazard refused to follow him.</p>

<p>Connected with the last-mentioned doctrines was
their famous theory of the ‘rehabilitation of the flesh,’
deduced from the philosophic theory of the school, which
was a species of pantheism, though they repudiated
the name. On this theory they rejected the dualism
so much emphasised by Catholic Christianity in its
penances and mortifications, and held that the body
should be restored to its due place of honour. It is a
vague principle, of which the ethical character depends
<span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span>
on the interpretation; and it was variously interpreted
in the school of Saint-Simon. It was certainly immoral
as held by Enfantin, by whom it was developed into a
kind of sensual mysticism, a system of free love with a
religious sanction.<a id='r1_2'/><a href='#f1_2' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>The good and bad aspects of the Saint-Simon
socialism are too obvious to require elucidation. The
antagonism between the old economic order and the
new had only begun to declare itself. The extent and
violence of the disease were not yet apparent: both
diagnosis and remedy were superficial and premature.
Such deep-seated organic disorder was not to be conjured
away by the waving of a magic wand. The
movement was all too utopian and extravagant in much
of its activity. The most prominent portion of the
school attacked social order in its essential point—the
family morality—adopting the worst features of a fantastic,
arrogant, and prurient sacerdotalism, and parading
them in the face of Europe. Thus it happened that
a school which attracted so many of the most brilliant
and promising young men of France, which was so
striking and original in its criticism of the existing
condition of things, which was so strong in the spirit of
initiative, and was in many ways so noble, unselfish, and
aspiring, sank amidst the laughter and indignation of
a scandalised society.</p>

<h3><span class='it'>FOURIER</span></h3>

<p>Considered as a purely literary and speculative product,
the socialism of Fourier was prior to those both
of Owen and Saint-Simon. Fourier’s first work, <span class='it'>Théorie
des Quatre Movements</span>, was published as early as 1808.
His system, however, scarcely attracted any attention
and exercised no influence till the movements originated
by Owen and Saint-Simon had begun to decline.</p>

<p>The socialism of Fourier is in many respects fundamentally
different from that of Saint-Simon; in the
two schools, in fact, we find the two opposing types of
socialism which have continued to prevail ever since.
Saint-Simonism represented the principle of authority,
of centralisation; while Fourier made all possible provision
for local and individual freedom. With Saint-Simonism
the State is the starting-point, the normal
and dominant power; in Fourier the like position is
held by a local body, corresponding to the commune,
which he called the <span class='it'>Phalange</span>. In the system of
Fourier the <span class='it'>phalange</span> holds the supreme and central
place, other organisation in comparison with it being
secondary and subordinate.</p>

<p>The deviser of the <span class='it'>phalange</span>, François Marie Charles
Fourier<a id='r1_3'/><a href='#f1_3' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a> was a very remarkable man. He was born at
Besançon in 1772, and received from his father, a prosperous
<span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'></span>
draper, an excellent education at the academy
of his native town. The boy excelled in the studies of
the school, and regretfully abandoned them for a business
career, which he followed in various towns of
France. As a commercial traveller in Holland and
Germany he enlarged his experience of men and things.
From his father Fourier inherited a sum of about
£3000, with which he started business at Lyons, but
he lost all he had in the siege of that city by the
Jacobins during the Reign of Terror, was thrown into
prison, and narrowly escaped the guillotine. On his
release he joined the army for two years, and then
returned to his old way of life.</p>

<p>At a very early age Fourier had his attention called
to the defects of the prevalent commercial system.
When only five years old he had been punished for
speaking the truth about certain goods in his father’s
shop; and at the age of twenty-seven he had at Marseilles
to superintend the destruction of an immense
quantity of rice held for higher prices during a scarcity
of food till it had become unfit for use. The conviction
grew within him that a system which involved such
abuses and immoralities must be radically evil. Feeling
that it was his mission to find a remedy for it, he spent
his life in the discovery, elucidation, and propagation of
a better order; and he brought to his task a self-denial
and singleness of purpose which have seldom been
surpassed. For the last ten years of his life he waited
in his apartments at noon every day for the wealthy
capitalist who should supply the means for the realisation
<span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span>
of his schemes. The tangible success obtained by
his system was very slight. His works found few
readers and still fewer disciples.</p>

<p>It was chiefly after the decline of the Saint-Simon
movement that he gained a hearing and a little, success.
A small group of enthusiastic adherents gathered round
him; a journal was started for the propagation of his
views; and in 1832 an attempt was made on lands near
Versailles to establish a <span class='it'>phalange</span>, which, however,
proved a total failure. In 1837 Fourier passed away
from a world that showed little inclination to listen to
his teaching. A singular altruism was in his character
blended with the most sanguine confidence in the
possibilities of human progress. Perhaps the weakest
point in his teaching was that he so greatly underestimated
the strength of the unregenerate residuum in
human nature. His own life was a model of simplicity,
integrity, kindliness, and disinterested devotion to what
he deemed the highest aims.</p>

<p>The social system of Fourier was, we need not say,
the central point in his speculations. But as his social
system was moulded and coloured by his peculiar views
on theology, cosmogony, and psychology, we must give
some account of those aspects of his teaching. In
theology Fourier inclined, though not decidedly, to what
is called pantheism; the pantheistic conception of the
world which underlay the Saint-Simon theory of the
‘rehabilitation of the flesh’ may be said to form the
basis also of the social ethics and arrangements of
Fourier. Along with this he held a natural optimism
<span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span>
of the most radical and comprehensive character. God
has done all things well, only man has misunderstood
and thwarted His benevolent purposes. God pervades
everything as a universal attraction. Whereas Newton
discovered that the law of attraction governs one movement
of the world, Fourier shows that it is universal,
ruling the world in all its movements, which are four—material,
organic, intellectual, and social. It is the
same law of attraction which pervades all things, from
the cosmic harmony of the stars down to the puny life
of the minutest insect, and which would reign also in
the human soul and in human society, if the intentions
of the Creator were understood. In the elucidation of
his system Fourier’s aim simply is to interpret the
intentions of the Creator. He regards his philosophy,
not as ingenious guesses or speculations, but as discoveries
plainly traceable from a few first principles;
discoveries in no way doubtful, but the fruit of clear
insight into the divine law.</p>

<p>The cosmogony of Fourier is the most fantastic part
of a fantastic system. But as he did not consider his
views in this department an essential part of his system,
we need not dwell upon them. He believed that the
world is to exist for eighty thousand years, forty
thousand years of progress being followed by forty
thousand years of decline. As yet it has not reached
the adult stage, having lasted only seven thousand
years. The present stage of the world is civilisation,
which Fourier uses as a comprehensive term for everything
artificial and corrupt, the result of perverted
<span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span>
human institutions, themselves due to the fact that we
have for five thousand years misunderstood the intentions
of the Creator. The head and front of this misunderstanding
consists in our pronouncing passions to
be bad that are simply natural; and there is but one
way of redressing it—to give a free and healthy and
complete development to our passions.</p>

<p>This leads us to the psychology of Fourier. He
recognised twelve radical passions connected with three
points of attraction. Five are sensitive (tending to
enjoyment)—sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch.
Four are affective (tending to groups)—love, friendship,
ambition, and <span class='it'>familism</span> or paternity. The meaning and
function of these are obvious enough. The remaining
three, the <span class='it'>alternating</span>, <span class='it'>emulative</span>, and <span class='it'>composite</span> (which
he calls <span class='it'>passions rectrices</span>, and which tend to series or to
unity), are more special to Fourier. Of the three the
first is connected with the need of variety; the second
leads to intrigue and jealousy; the third, full of intoxication
and abandonment, is born of the combination
of several pleasures of the senses and of the soul
enjoyed simultaneously. The passions of the first two
classes are so far controlled by the <span class='it'>passions rectrices</span>,
and especially by the composite passion; but even the
<span class='it'>passions rectrices</span> obviously contain elements of discord
and war. All, however, are ultimately harmonised by a
great social passion, which Fourier calls <span class='it'>Unitéisme</span>. Out
of the free play of all the passions harmony is evolved,
like white out of the combination of the colours.</p>

<p>The speedy passage from social chaos to universal
<span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span>
harmony contemplated by Fourier can, as we have seen,
be accomplished only by one method, by giving to the
human passions their natural development. For this
end, a complete break with civilisation must be made.
We must have new social arrangements suitable to
human nature and in harmony with the intentions of
the Creator. These Fourier provides in the <span class='it'>phalange</span>.
In its normal form the <span class='it'>phalange</span> was to consist of four
hundred families or eighteen hundred persons, living on
a square league of land, self-contained and self-sufficing
for the most part, and combining within itself the means
for the free development of the most varied likings and
capacities. It was an institution in which agriculture,
industry, the appliances and opportunities of enjoyment,
and generally of the widest and freest human development,
are combined, the interests of individual freedom
and of common union being reconciled in a way hitherto
unknown and unimagined.</p>

<p>While the <span class='it'>phalange</span> is the social unit, the individuals
composing it will arrange themselves in groups of seven
or nine persons; from twenty-four to thirty-two groups
form a series, and these unite to form a <span class='it'>phalange</span>—all
according to principles of attraction, of free elective
affinity. The dwelling of the <span class='it'>phalange</span> was the <span class='it'>phalanstère</span>,
a vast, beautiful, and commodious structure, where
life could be arranged to suit every one, common or
solitary, according to preference; but under such conditions
there would be neither excuse nor motive for
the selfish seclusion, isolation, and suspicion so prevalent
in civilisation.
<span class='pageno' title='37' id='Page_37'></span></p>

<p>In such an institution it is obvious that government
under the form of compulsion and restraint would be
reduced to a minimum. The officials of the <span class='it'>phalange</span>
would be elected. The <span class='it'>phalange</span>, itself was an experiment
on a local scale, which could easily be made, and
once successfully made would lead to world-wide imitation.
They would freely group themselves into wider
combinations with elected chiefs, and the <span class='it'>phalanges</span> of
the whole world would form a great federation with a
single elected chief, resident at Constantinople, which
would be the universal capital.</p>

<p>In all the arrangements of the <span class='it'>phalange</span> the principle
of free attraction would be observed. Love would be
free. Free unions should be formed, which could
be dissolved, or which might grow into permanent
marriage.</p>

<p>The labour of the <span class='it'>phalange</span> would be conducted on
scientific methods; but it would, above all things, be
made <span class='it'>attractive</span>, by consulting the likings and capacities
of the members, by frequent change of occupation,
by recourse to the principle of emulation in individuals,
groups, and series. On the principle that men and
women are eager for the greatest exertion, if only they
like it, Fourier bases his theory that all labour can be
made attractive by appealing to appropriate motives in
human nature. Obviously, also, what is now the most
disgusting labour could be more effectually performed
by machinery.</p>

<p>The product of labour was to be distributed in the
following manner:—Out of the common gain of the
<span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span>
<span class='it'>phalange</span> a very comfortable minimum was assured to
every member. Of the remainder, five-twelfths went
to labour, four-twelfths to capital, and three-twelfths
to talent. In the <span class='it'>phalange</span>, individual capital existed,
and inequality of talent was not only admitted, but
insisted upon and utilised. In the actual distribution
the <span class='it'>phalange</span> treated with individuals. With regard to
the remuneration of individuals under the head of
capital no difficulty could be felt, as a normal rate of
interest would be given on the advances made. Individual
talent would be rewarded in accordance with
the services rendered in the management of the
<span class='it'>phalange</span>, the place of each being determined by election.
Labour would be remunerated on a principle
entirely different from the present. Hard and common
or necessary work should be best paid; useful work
should come next, and pleasant work last of all. In
any case the reward of labour would be so great that
every one would have the opportunity of becoming a
capitalist.</p>

<p>One of the most notable results of the <span class='it'>phalange</span>
treating with each member individually is, that the
economic independence of women would be assured.
Even the child of five would have its own share in the
produce.</p>

<p>The system of Fourier may fairly be described as
one of the most ingenious and elaborate Utopias ever
devised by the human brain. But in many cardinal
points it has been constructed in complete contradiction
to all that experience and science have taught us of
<span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span>
human nature and the laws of social evolution. He
particularly underestimates the force of human egotism.
From the beginning progress has consisted essentially
in the hard and strenuous repression of the beast within
the man, whereas Fourier would give it free rein. This
applies to his system as a whole, and especially to his
theories on marriage. Instead of supplying a sudden
passage from social chaos to universal harmony, his
system would, after entirely subverting such order as
we have, only bring us back to social chaos.</p>

<p>Yet his works are full of suggestion and instruction,
and will long repay the study of the social economist.
His criticisms of the existing system, of its waste,
anarchy, and immorality, are ingenious, searching, and
often most convincing. In his positive proposals, too,
are to be found some of the most sagacious and far-reaching
forecasts of the future landmarks of human
progress. Most noteworthy are the guarantees he
devised for individual and local freedom. The <span class='it'>phalange</span>
was on the one hand large enough to secure all the
benefits of a scientific industry and of a varied common
life; on the other it provides against the evils of centralisation,
of State despotism, of false patriotism and
national jealousy. Fourier has forecast the part to be
played in the social and political development of the
future by the local body, whether we call it commune,
parish, or municipality. The fact that he has given it
a fantastic name, and surrounded it with many fantastic
conditions, should not hinder us from recognising his
great sagacity and originality.
<span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span></p>

<p>The freedom of the individual and of the minority
is, moreover, protected against the possible tyranny of
the <span class='it'>phalange</span> by the existence, under reasonable limits
and under social control, of individual capital. This
individual capital, further, is perfectly <span class='it'>mobile</span>; that is,
the possessor of it, if he thinks fit to migrate or go
on travel, may remove his capital, and find a welcome
for his labour, talent, and investments in any part of
the world. Such arrangements of Fourier may suggest
a much-needed lesson to many of the contemporary
adherents of ‘scientific socialism.’</p>

<p>While, therefore, we believe that Fourier’s system
was as a whole entirely utopian, he has with great
sagacity drawn the outlines of much of our political
and social progress; and while we believe that the full
development of human passions as recommended by
him would soon reduce us to social chaos, a time may
come in our ethical and rational growth when a widening
freedom may be permitted and exercised, not by
casting off moral law, but by the perfect assimilation
of it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br/><br/>FRENCH SOCIALISM OF 1848</h2>

<p>The year 1830 was an important era in the history of
socialism. During the fermentation of that time the
activity of the Saint-Simon school came to a crisis, and
the theories of Fourier had an opportunity of taking
practical shape. But by far the greatest result for
socialism of the revolutionary period of 1830 was the
definite establishment of the contrast between the
<span class='it'>bourgeoisie</span> and proletariat in France and England, the
two countries that held the foremost place in the modern
industrial, social, and political movement. Hitherto
the men who were afterwards destined consciously to
constitute those two classes had fought side by side
against feudalism and the reaction. Through the
restricted franchise introduced at this period in the two
countries just mentioned the middle class had become
the ruling power.</p>

<p>Excluded from political privileges and pressed by the
weight of adverse economic, conditions, the proletariat
now appeared as the revolutionary party. The first
symptom in France of the altered state of things was
the outbreak at Lyons in 1831, when the starving
<span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span>
workmen rose to arms with the device, ‘Live working,
or die fighting.’ Chartism was a larger phase of the
same movement in England. The theories of Saint-Simon
and Fourier had met with acceptance chiefly or
entirely among the educated classes. Socialism now
directly appealed to the working men.</p>

<p>In this chapter our concern is with the development
of the new form of socialism in France. Paris, which
had so long been the centre of revolutionary activity,
was now, and particularly during the latter half of the
reign of the <span class='it'>bourgeois</span> King, Louis Philippe, the seat of
socialistic fermentation. In 1839 Louis Blanc published
his <span class='it'>Organisation du travail</span>, and Cabet his <span class='it'>Voyage
en Icarie</span>. In 1840 Proudhon brought out his book on
property. Paris was the school to which youthful
innovators went to learn the lesson of revolution. At
this period she counted among her visitors Lassalle, the
founder of the Social Democracy of Germany; Karl
Marx, the chief of scientific international socialism;
and Bakunin, the apostle of anarchism.</p>

<p>The socialistic speculation associated with the three
men last mentioned was to have a far-reaching influence;
but it did not attain to full development till a
later period. The socialistic activity of Louis Blanc and
Proudhon culminated during the revolution of 1848,
and exercised considerable influence on the course of
events in Paris at that time.
<span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span></p>

<h3><span class='it'>LOUIS BLANC</span></h3>

<p>The socialism of Saint-Simon and Fourier was, as
we have seen, largely imaginative and Utopian, and
had only a very remote connection with the practical
life of their time. With Louis Blanc the movement
came into real contact with the national history of
France. In Louis Blanc’s teaching the most conspicuous
feature was that he demanded the democratic
organisation of the State as preparatory to social reorganisation.
His system, therefore, had a positive
and practical basis, in so far as it allied itself to a
dominant tendency in the existing State.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary here to recapitulate in detail the
life of Louis Blanc. He was born in 1811 at Madrid,
where his father was inspector-general of finance under
Joseph during his uncertain tenure of the Spanish
throne. At an early age he attained to eminence as a
journalist in Paris, and in 1839 established the <span class='it'>Revue
du progrès</span>, in which he first brought out his celebrated
work on Socialism, the <span class='it'>Organisation du travail</span>.
It was soon published in book form, and found a wide
popularity among the workmen of France, who were
captivated by the brilliancy of the style, the fervid
eloquence with which it exposed existing abuses, and
the simplicity and democratic fitness of the schemes for
the regeneration of society which it advocated.</p>

<p>The greater part of the book is taken up with
unsparing denunciations of the evils of competition,
<span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span>
which, as common to Louis Blanc with other socialists,
need not detain us. More interesting are the practical
measures for their removal, proposed in his treatise.<a id='r1_4'/><a href='#f1_4' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a>
Like the socialists that preceded him, L. Blanc cannot
accept the views which teach a necessary antagonism
between soul and body; we must aim at the harmonious
development of both sides of our nature. The
formula of progress is double in its unity: moral and
material amelioration of the lot of all by the free co-operation
of all, and their fraternal association.<a id='r2_4'/><a href='#f2_4' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a> He
saw, however, that social reform could not be attained
without political reform. The first is the end, the
second is the means. It was not enough to discover the
true methods for inaugurating the principle of association
and for organising labour in accordance with the
rules of reason, justice, and humanity. It was necessary
to have political power on the side of social reform,
political power resting on the Chambers, on the
tribunals, and on the army: not to take it as an
instrument was to meet it as an obstacle.</p>

<p>For these reasons he wished to see the State constituted
on a thoroughly democratic basis, as the first
condition of success. The emancipation of the proletarians
was a question so difficult that it would require
the whole force of the State for its solution. What
is wanting to the working class are the instruments of
labour; the function of Government is to furnish them.
If we had to define what we consider the State to be,
<span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span>
we should reply, ‘The State is the banker of the
poor.’</p>

<p>Louis Blanc demanded that the democratic State
should create industrial associations, which he called
<span class='it'>social workshops</span>, and which were destined gradually and
without shock to supersede individual workshops. The
State would provide the means; it would draw up the
rules for their constitution, and it would appoint the
functionaries for the first year. But, once founded and
set in movement, the social workshop would be self-supporting,
self-acting, and self-governing. The workmen
would choose their own directors and managers,
they would themselves arrange the division of the
profits, and would take measures to extend the enterprise
commenced.</p>

<p>In such a system where would there be room for
arbitrary rule or tyranny? The State would establish
the social workshops, would pass laws for them, and
supervise their execution for the good of all; but its
<span class='it'>rôle</span> would end there. Is this, can this be tyranny?
Thus the freedom of the industrial associations and of
the individuals composing them would not only remain
intact; it would have the solid support of the State.
The intervention of a democratic Government on behalf
of the people, whom it represented, would remove the
misery, anarchy, and oppression necessarily attendant
on the competitive system, and in place of the delusive
liberty of <span class='it'>laissez-faire</span>, would establish a real and positive
freedom.</p>

<p>With regard to the remuneration of talent and labour
<span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span>
L. Blanc takes very high ground. ‘Genius,’ he said,
‘should assert its legitimate empire, not by the amount
of the tribute which it will levy on society, but by the
greatness of the services which it will render.’ This is
no mere flourish of eloquence; it is to be the principle
of remuneration in his association. Society could not,
even if it would, repay the genius of a Newton; Newton
had his just recompense in the joy of discovering the
laws by which worlds are governed. Exceptional endowments
must find development and a fitting reward
in the exceptional services they render to society.</p>

<p>L. Blanc therefore believed in a hierarchy according
to capacity; remuneration according to capacity he
admitted in the earlier editions of his work, but only
provisionally and as a concession to prevalent anti-social
opinion. In the edition of 1848, the year when his
theories attained for a time to historic importance, he
had withdrawn this concession. ‘Though the false and
anti-social education given to the present generation
makes it difficult to find any other motive of emulation
and encouragement than a higher salary, the wages will
be equal, as the ideas and character of men will be
changed by an absolutely new education.’<a id='r3_4'/><a href='#f3_4' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a> Private
capitalists would be invited to join the associations,
and would under fixed conditions receive interest for
their advances; but as the collective capital increased,
the opportunities for so placing individual capital would
surely diminish. The tyranny of capital would, in fact,
receive a mortal wound.</p>

<p><span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span></p>

<p>The revolution of 1848 was an important stage in
the development of democracy. In ancient and also in
mediæval times the democracy was associated with city
life; the citizens personally appeared and spoke and
voted in the Assemblies. The modern democracy has
grown in large States, extending over wide territories,
and the citizen can exercise political power only through
elected representatives. Hence the importance of the
franchise in modern politics. The evolution of the
modern democracy has gone through a long succession
of phases, beginning with the early growth of the
English Parliament, and continued in the struggles of
the Dutch against the Spaniards, in the English Revolutions
of 1642 and 1688, in the American Revolution of
1776, and the French Revolution of 1789. In the early
struggles, however, the mass of the people had no very
great share. It was hardly till 1848 that the working
class made its entrance on the stage of history—in
Europe at least.</p>

<p>The revolutionary disturbances of 1848 affected nearly
the whole of western and central Europe. It was a rising
of the peoples against antiquated political forms and
institutions; against the arrangements of the Treaty of
Vienna, whereby Europe was partitioned according to
the convenience of ruling houses; against irresponsible
Governments, which took no account of the wishes of
their subjects.</p>

<p>In France, the country with which we are now
specially concerned, the revolution was a revolt of the
people against a representative monarchy with a very
<span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span>
restricted franchise. It was not a deeply-planned
rising, and, indeed, was a surprise to those who wished
it and accomplished it. Yet it marked a most important
stage in the progress of the world, for, as a
result of it, men for the first time saw the legislature of
a great country established on principles of universal
suffrage, and the cause of the working men recognised
as a supreme duty of government.</p>

<p>Louis Blanc was the most prominent actor in what
may be called the social-democratic side of the French
Revolution of 1848. Through his influence with the
working classes, and as representing their feelings and
aspirations, he obtained a place in the Provisional
Government. He was supported there by others like-minded
with himself, including one working man,
whose appearance in such a capacity was also a notable
event in modern history. But though circumstances
were so far favourable, he did not accomplish much. It
cannot be said that his plans obtained a fair hearing or
a fair trial. He was present in the Provisional Government
as the pioneer of a new cause whose time had not
yet come.</p>

<p>The schemes for social reconstruction which he contemplated
were certainly not carried out in the <span class='it'>national
workshops</span> of that year. From the report of the Commission
of Inquiry into the subject, subsequently
instituted by the French Government, and from the
<span class='it'>History of the National Workshops</span>, written by their
director, Emile Thomas, it is perfectly clear that the
<span class='it'>national workshops</span> were simply a travesty of the proposals
<span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span>
of Louis Blanc, established expressly to discredit
them. They were a means of finding work for the motley
proletariat thrown out of employment during the period
of revolutionary disturbance, and those men were put
to unproductive labour; whereas, of course, Louis Blanc
contemplated nothing but productive work, and the
men he proposed inviting to join his associations were
to give guarantees of character. It was intended, too,
by his opponents that the mob of workmen whom they
employed in the so-called <span class='it'>national workshops</span> would be
ready to assist their masters in the event of a struggle
with the socialist party.</p>

<p>A number of private associations of a kind similar
to those proposed by Louis Blanc were indeed subsidised
by the Government. But of the whole sum
voted for this end, which amounted to only £120,000,
the greater part was applied to purposes quite foreign
from the grant. It was not the intention of the moving
spirits of the Government that they should succeed.
Moreover, the months following the revolution of
February were a period of industrial stagnation and
insecurity, when any project of trade, either on the old
or on the new lines, had little prospect of success.
Under these circumstances, the fact that a few of the
associations did prosper very fairly may be accepted
as proof that the scheme of Louis Blanc had in it the
elements of vitality. The history of the whole matter
fully justifies the exclamation of Lassalle that ‘lying is
a European power.’<a id='r4_4'/><a href='#f4_4' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[4]</span></sup></a> It has been the subject of endless
<span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'></span>
misrepresentation by writers who have taken no pains
to verify the facts.</p>

<p>As one of the leaders during this difficult crisis, Louis
Blanc had neither personal force nor enduring political
influence sufficient to secure any solid success for his
cause. He was an amiable, genial, and eloquent
enthusiast, but without weight enough to be a controller
of men on a wide scale. The Labour Conferences at the
Luxembourg, over which he presided, ended also, as his
opponents desired, without any tangible result.</p>

<p>The Assembly, elected on the principle of universal
suffrage, which met in May, showed that the peasantry
and the mass of the French people were not in accord
with the working classes of Paris and of the industrial
centres. It did not approve of the social-democratic
activity urged by a section of the Provisional Government.
The national workshops also were closed, and the
proletariat of Paris rose in armed insurrection, which
was overthrown by Cavaignac in the sanguinary days of
June. Louis Blanc was in no way responsible for the
revolt, which can be called socialistic only in the sense
that the proletariat was engaged in it, the class of which
socialism claims to be the special champion.

<h3><span class='it'>PROUDHON</span></h3>

<p>Pierre Joseph Proudhon was born in 1809 at Besançon,
France, the native place also of the socialist Fourier.
His origin was of the humblest, his father being a
brewer’s cooper, and the boy herded cows and did
such other work as came in his way. But he was not
entirely self-educated; at sixteen he entered the college
of his native place, though his family was so poor that
he could not procure the necessary books, and had
to borrow them from his mates in order to copy the
lessons. There is a story of the young Proudhon
returning home laden with prizes, but to find that
there was no dinner for him.</p>

<p>At nineteen he became a working compositor, and
was afterwards promoted to be a corrector for the press,
reading proofs of ecclesiastical works, and thereby
acquiring a considerable knowledge of theology. In
this way he also came to learn Hebrew, and to compare
it with Greek, Latin, and French. It was the first
proof of his intellectual audacity that on the strength
of this he wrote an <span class='it'>Essai de grammaire générale</span>. As
Proudhon knew nothing whatever of the true principles
of philology, his treatise was of no value.</p>

<p>In 1838 he obtained the <span class='it'>pension Suard</span>, a bursary of
1500 francs a year for three years, for the encouragement
of young men of promise, which was in the gift
of the Academy of Besançon. Next year he wrote a
treatise <span class='it'>On the Utility of Keeping the Sunday</span>, which
<span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'></span>
contained the germs of his revolutionary ideas. About
this time he went to Paris, where he lived a poor,
ascetic, and studious life, making acquaintance, however,
with the socialistic ideas which were then
fermenting in the capital.</p>

<p>In 1840 he published his first work, <span class='it'>Qu’est-ce que la
propriété?</span> (What is Property?) His famous answer
to this question, <span class='it'>La propriété c’est le vol</span> (Property is
theft), naturally did not please the academy of Besançon,
and there was some talk of withdrawing his
pension; but he held it for the regular period.<a id='r1_5'/><a href='#f1_5' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>For his third memoir on property, which took the
shape of a letter to the Fourierist, M. Considérant, he
was tried at Besançon, but was acquitted. In 1846 he
published his greatest work, the <span class='it'>Système des contradictions
économiques, ou philosophie de la misère</span>. For some
time Proudhon carried on a small printing establishment
at Besançon, but without success; and afterwards
held a post as a kind of manager with a commercial firm
at Lyons. In 1847 he left this employment, and finally
settled in Paris, where he was now becoming celebrated
as a leader of innovation.</p>

<p>He regretted the sudden outbreak of the revolution
of February, because it found the social reformers
unprepared; but he threw himself with ardour into
the conflict of opinion, and soon gained a national
<span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span>
notoriety. He was the moving spirit of the <span class='it'>Représentant
du Peuple</span> and other journals, in which the most
advanced theories were advocated in the strongest
language; and as member of Assembly for the Seine
department he brought forward his celebrated proposal
for exacting an impost of one-third on interest and rent,
which of course was rejected. His attempt to found a
bank which should operate by granting gratuitous credit,
was also a complete failure; of the five million francs
which he required, only seventeen thousand were offered.
The violence of his utterances led to an imprisonment
at Paris for three years, during which he married a
young working woman.</p>

<p>As Proudhon aimed at economic rather than political
innovation, he had no special quarrel with the Second
Empire, and he lived in comparative quiet under it till
the publication of his work, <span class='it'>De la justice dans la révolution
et dans l’église</span> (1858), in which he attacked the
Church and other existing institutions with unusual
fury. This time he fled to Brussels to escape imprisonment.
On his return to France his health broke down,
though he continued to write. He died at Passy in
1865.</p>

<p>Personally, Proudhon was one of the most remarkable
figures of modern France. His life was marked
by the severest simplicity and even puritanism; he
was affectionate in his domestic relations, a most loyal
friend, and strictly upright in conduct. He was
strongly opposed to the prevailing French socialism
of his time because of its utopianism and immorality;
<span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span>
and, though he uttered all manner of wild paradox and
vehement invective against the dominant ideas and
institutions, he was remarkably free from feelings of
personal hate. In all that he said and did he was
the son of the people, who had not been broken to
the usual social and academic discipline; hence his
roughness, his one-sidedness, and his exaggerations. But
he is always vigorous, and often brilliant and original.</p>

<p>It would obviously be impossible to reduce the ideas
of such an irregular thinker to systematic form. In
later years Proudhon himself confessed that ‘the great
part of his publications formed only a work of dissection
and ventilation, so to speak, by means of which he
slowly makes his way towards a superior conception of
political and economic laws.’ Yet the groundwork of
his teaching is clear and firm; no one could insist with
greater emphasis on the demonstrative character of
economic principles as understood by himself. He
strongly believed in the absolute truth of a few moral
ideas, with which it was the aim of his teaching to
mould and suffuse political economy. Of these fundamental
ideas, justice, liberty, and equality were the
chief. What he desiderated, for instance, in an ideal
society was the most perfect equality of remuneration.
It was his principle that service pays service, that a
day’s labour balances a day’s labour—in other words,
that the duration of labour is the just measure of value.
He did not shrink from any of the consequences of
this theory, for he would give the same remuneration
to the worst mason as to a Phidias; but he looks forward
<span class='pageno' title='55' id='Page_55'></span>
also to a period in human development when the
present inequality in the talent and capacity of men
would be reduced to an inappreciable minimum.</p>

<p>From the great principle of service as the equivalent
of service he derived his axiom that property is the
right of <span class='it'>aubaine</span>. The <span class='it'>aubain</span> was a stranger not
naturalised; and the right of <span class='it'>aubaine</span> was the right in
virtue of which the Sovereign claimed the goods of such
a stranger who had died in his territory. Property is
a right of the same nature, with a like power of appropriation
in the form of rent, interest, etc. It reaps
without labour, consumes without producing, and enjoys
without exertion.</p>

<p>Proudhon’s aim, therefore, was to realise a science of
society resting on principles of justice, liberty, and
equality thus understood; ‘a science, absolute, rigorous,
based on the nature of man and of his faculties,
and on their mutual relations; a science which we
have not to invent, but to discover.’ But he saw
clearly that such ideas, with their necessary accompaniments,
could be realised only through a long and
laborious process of social transformation. As we have
said, he strongly detested the prurient immorality of
the schools of Saint-Simon and Fourier. He attacked
them not less bitterly for thinking that society could
be changed off-hand by a ready-made and complete
scheme of reform. It was ‘the most accursed lie,’ he
said, ‘that could be offered to mankind.’</p>

<p>In social change he distinguishes between the transition
and the perfection or achievement. With regard
<span class='pageno' title='56' id='Page_56'></span>
to the transition he advocated the progressive abolition
of the right of <span class='it'>aubaine</span>, by reducing interest, rent,
etc. For the goal he professed only to give the general
principles; he had no ready-made scheme, no Utopia.
The positive organisation of the new society in its
details was a labour that would require fifty Montesquieus.
The organisation he desired was one on
collective principles, a free association which would
take account of the division of labour, and which
would maintain the personality both of the man and
the citizen. With his strong and fervid feeling for
human dignity and liberty, Proudhon could not have
tolerated any theory of social change that did not give
full scope for the free development of man. Connected
with this was his famous paradox of <span class='it'>anarchy</span>, as the
goal of the free development of society, by which he
meant that through the ethical progress of men government
should become unnecessary. Each man should
be a law to himself. ‘Government of man by man
in every form,’ he says, ‘is oppression. The highest
perfection of society is found in the union of order and
<span class='it'>anarchy</span>.’</p>

<p>Proudhon’s theory of property as the right of <span class='it'>aubaine</span>
is substantially the same as the theory of capital held
by Marx and most of the later socialists. Property
and capital are defined and treated as the power of
exploiting the labour of other men, of claiming the
results of labour without giving an equivalent. Proudhon’s
famous paradox, ‘Property is theft,’ is merely a
trenchant expression of this general principle. As
<span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'></span>
slavery is assassination inasmuch as it destroys all that
is valuable and desirable in human personality, so
property is theft inasmuch as it appropriates the value
produced by the labour of others in the form of rent,
interest, or profit without rendering an equivalent.
For property Proudhon would substitute individual
possession, the right of occupation being equal for all
men.</p>

<p>With the bloodshed of the days of June French
socialism ceased for a time to be a considerable force;
and Paris, too, for a time lost its place as the great
centre of innovation. The rising removed the most
enterprising leaders of the workmen and quelled the
spirit of the remainder, while the false prosperity of
the Second Empire relieved their most urgent grievances.
Under Napoleon III. there was consequently
comparative quietness in France. Even the International
had very little influence on French soil,
though French working men had an important share in
originating it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br/><br/>EARLY ENGLISH SOCIALISM</h2>

<p>Compared with the parallel movement in France the
early socialism of England had an uneventful history.
In order to appreciate the significance of Robert
Owen’s work it is necessary to recall some of the most
important features of the social condition of the country
in his time. The English worker had no fixed interest
in the soil. He had no voice either in local or national
government. He had little education or none at all.
His dwelling was wretched in the extreme. The
right even of combination was denied him till 1824.
The wages of the agricultural labourer were miserably
low.</p>

<p>The workman’s share in the benefits of the industrial
revolution was doubtful. Great numbers of his class
were reduced to utter poverty and ruin by the
great changes consequent on the introduction of
machinery; the tendency to readjustment was slow
and continually disturbed by fresh change. The hours
of work were mercilessly long. He had to compete
against the labour of women, and of children brought
frequently at the age of five or six from the workhouses.
<span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span>
These children had to work the same long
hours as the adults, and they were sometimes very
cruelly treated by the overseers. Destitute as they so
often were of parental protection and oversight, with
both sexes huddled together under immoral and
insanitary conditions, it was only natural that they
should fall into the worst habits, and that their offspring
should to such a lamentable degree be vicious,
improvident, and physically degenerate.</p>

<p>In a country where the labourers had neither
education nor political or social rights, and where the
peasantry were practically landless serfs, the old
English poor law was only a doubtful part of an evil
system. All these permanent causes of mischief were
aggravated by special causes connected with the cessation
of the Napoleonic wars, which are well known.
It was in such circumstances, when English pauperism
had become a grave national question, that Owen first
brought forward his scheme of socialism.</p>

<p>Robert Owen, philanthropist, and founder of English
socialism, was born at the village of Newtown,
Montgomeryshire, North Wales, in 1771.<a id='r1_6'/><a href='#f1_6' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a> His father
<span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'></span>
had a small business in Newtown as saddler and ironmonger,
and there young Owen received all his school
education, which terminated at the age of nine. At
ten he went to Stamford, where he served in a
draper’s shop for three or four years, and, after a
short experience of work in a London shop, removed to
Manchester.</p>

<p>His success at Manchester was very rapid. When
only nineteen years of age he became manager of a
cotton-mill, in which five hundred people were employed,
and by his administrative intelligence, energy,
industry, and steadiness, soon made it one of the best
establishments of the kind in Great Britain. In this
factory Owen used the first bags of American Sea-Island
cotton ever imported into the country; it was
the first cotton obtained from the Southern States of
America. Owen also made remarkable improvement
in the quality of the cotton spun. Indeed there is no
reason to doubt that at this early age he was the first
cotton-spinner in England, a position entirely due to
his own capacity and knowledge of the trade, as he had
found the mill in no well-ordered condition and was
left to organise it entirely on his own responsibility.</p>

<p>Owen had become manager and one of the partners
of the Chorlton Twist Company at Manchester, when
he made his first acquaintance with the scene of his
future philanthropic efforts at New Lanark. During a
visit to Glasgow he had fallen in love with the daughter
of the proprietor of the New Lanark mills, Mr. Dale.
Owen induced his partners to purchase New Lanark;
<span class='pageno' title='61' id='Page_61'></span>
and after his marriage with Miss Dale he settled there,
in 1800, as manager and part owner of the mills.
Encouraged by his great success in the management of
cotton-factories in Manchester, he had already formed
the intention of conducting New Lanark on higher
principles than the current commercial ones.</p>

<p>The factory of New Lanark had been started in
1784 by Dale and Arkwright, the water-power afforded
by the falls of the Clyde being the great attraction.
Connected with the mills were about two thousand
people, five hundred of whom were children, brought,
most of them, at the age of five or six from the poorhouses
and charities of Edinburgh and Glasgow. The
children especially had been well treated by Dale, but
the general condition of the people was very unsatisfactory.
Many of them were the lowest of the population,
the respectable country-people refusing to submit
to the long hours and demoralising drudgery of the
factories. Theft, drunkenness, and other vices were
common; education and sanitation were alike neglected;
most families lived only in one room.</p>

<p>It was this population, thus committed to his care,
which Owen now set himself to elevate and ameliorate.
He greatly improved their houses, and by the unsparing
and benevolent exertion of his personal influence
trained them to habits of order, cleanliness, and thrift.
He opened a store, where the people could buy goods of
the soundest quality at little more than cost price;
and the sale of drink was placed under the strictest
supervision. His greatest success, however, was in the
<span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'></span>
education of the young, to which he devoted special
attention. He was the founder of infant schools in
Great Britain; and, though he was anticipated by
Continental reformers, he seems to have been led to
institute them by his own views of what education
ought to be, and without hint from abroad.</p>

<p>In all these plans Owen obtained the most gratifying
success. Though at first regarded with suspicion as a
stranger, he soon won the confidence of his people.
The mills continued to prosper commercially, but it is
needless to say that some of Owen’s schemes involved
considerable expense, which was displeasing to his
partners. Wearied at last of the restrictions imposed
on him by men who wished to conduct the business on
the ordinary principles, Owen, in 1813, formed a new
firm, whose members, content with 5 per cent of return
for their capital, would be ready to give freer scope to
his philanthropy. In this firm Jeremy Bentham and
the well-known Quaker, William Allen, were partners.</p>

<p>In the same year Owen first appeared as an author
of essays, in which he expounded the principles on which
his system of educational philanthropy was based.
From an early age he had lost all belief in the prevailing
forms of religion, and had thought out a creed
for himself, which he considered an entirely new and
original discovery. The chief points in this philosophy
were that man’s character is made not by him but for
him; that it has been formed by circumstances over
which he had no control; that he is not a proper subject
either of praise or blame—these principles leading
<span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span>
up to the practical conclusion that the great secret in
the right formation of man’s character is to place him
under the proper influences, physical, moral, and
social, from his earliest years. These principles, of
the irresponsibility of man and of the effect of early
influences, are the keynote of Owen’s whole system of
education and social amelioration. As we have said,
they are embodied in his first work, <span class='it'>A New View of
Society; or, Essays on the Principle of the Formation of
the Human Character</span>, the first of these essays (there
are four in all) being published in 1813. It is needless
to say that Owen’s new views theoretically belong to a
very old system of philosophy, and that his originality
is to be found only in his benevolent application of
them.</p>

<p>For the next few years Owen’s work at New Lanark
continued to have a national and even a European
significance. His schemes for the education of his
workpeople attained to something like completion on
the opening of the institution at New Lanark in 1816.
He was a zealous supporter of the factory legislation
resulting in the Act of 1819, which, however, greatly
disappointed him. He had interviews and communications
with the leading members of Government, including
the Premier, Lord Liverpool, and with many of
the rulers and leading statesmen of the Continent.
New Lanark itself became a much-frequented place of
pilgrimage for social reformers, statesmen, and royal
personages, amongst whom was Nicholas, afterwards
Emperor of Russia. According to the unanimous testimony
<span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span>
of all who visited it, the results achieved by Owen
were singularly good. The manners of the children,
brought up under his system, were beautifully graceful,
genial, and unconstrained; health, plenty, and contentment
prevailed; drunkenness was almost unknown, and
illegitimacy was extremely rare. The most perfect
good-feeling subsisted between Owen and his workpeople;
all the operations of the mill proceeded with
the utmost smoothness and regularity; and the business
still enjoyed great prosperity.</p>

<p>Hitherto Owen’s work had been that of a philanthropist,
whose great distinction was the originality
and unwearying unselfishness of his methods. His
first departure in socialism took place in 1817, and was
embodied in a report communicated to the Committee
of the House of Commons on the Poor Law. The
general misery and stagnation of trade consequent on
the termination of the great war were engrossing the
attention of the country. After clearly tracing the
special causes connected with the war which had led
to such a deplorable state of things, Owen pointed out
that the permanent cause of distress was to be found
in the competition of human labour with machinery,
and that the only effective remedy was the united
action of men, and the subordination of machinery.
His proposals for the treatment of pauperism were
based on these principles.</p>

<p>He recommended that communities of about twelve
hundred persons should be settled on spaces of land
of from 1000 to 1500 acres, all living in one large building
<span class='pageno' title='65' id='Page_65'></span>
in the form of a square, with public kitchen and
mess-rooms. Each family should have its own private
apartments, and the entire care of the children till the
age of three, after which they should be brought up by
the community, their parents having access to them at
meals and all other proper times. These communities
might be established by individuals, by parishes, by
counties, or by the State; in every case there should be
effective supervision by duly qualified persons. Work,
and the enjoyment of its results, should be in common.</p>

<p>The size of his community was no doubt partly
suggested by his village of New Lanark; and he soon
proceeded to advocate such a scheme as the best form
for the reorganisation of society in general. In its
fully developed form—and it cannot be said to have
changed much during Owen’s lifetime—it was as
follows. He considered an association of from 500 to
3000 as the fit number for a good working community.
While mainly agricultural, it should possess all the
best machinery, should offer every variety of employment,
and should, as far as possible, be self-contained.
In other words, his communities were intended to be self-dependent
units, which should provide the best education
and the constant exercise of unselfish intelligence,
should unite the advantages of town and country life,
and should correct the monotonous activity of the factory
with the freest variety of occupation, while utilising all
the latest improvements in industrial technique. ‘As
these townships,’ as he also called them, ‘should increase
in number, unions of them federatively united
<span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span>
shall be formed in circles of tens, hundreds, and
thousands,’ till they should embrace the whole world in
one great republic with a common interest.</p>

<p>His plans for the cure of pauperism were received
with great favour. The <span class='it'>Times</span> and the <span class='it'>Morning Post</span>,
and many of the leading men of the country, countenanced
them; one of his most steadfast friends was
the Duke of Kent, father of Queen Victoria. He had
indeed gained the ear of the country, and had the
prospect before him of a great career as a social
reformer, when he went out of his way at a large
meeting in London to declare his hostility to all the
received forms of religion. After this defiance to the
religious sentiment of the country, Owen’s theories were
in the popular mind associated with infidelity, and were
henceforward suspected and discredited.</p>

<p>Owen’s own confidence, however, remained unshaken,
and he was anxious that his scheme for establishing a
community should be tested. At last, in 1825, such an
experiment was attempted under the direction of his
disciple, Abram Combe, at Orbiston, near Glasgow; and
in the same year Owen himself commenced another at
New Harmony, in Indiana, America. After a trial of
about two years both failed completely. Neither of
them was a pauper experiment; but it must be said
that the members were of the most motley description,
many worthy people of the highest aims being mixed
with vagrants, adventurers, and crotchety wrong-headed
enthusiasts.</p>

<p>After a long period of friction with William Allen
<span class='pageno' title='67' id='Page_67'></span>
and some of his other partners, Owen resigned all
connection with New Lanark in 1828. On his return
from America he made London the centre of his
activity. Most of his means having been sunk in the
New Harmony experiment, he was no longer a flourishing
capitalist, but the head of a vigorous propaganda, in
which socialism and secularism were combined. One
of the most interesting features of the movement at
this period was the establishment in 1832 of an
equitable labour exchange system, in which exchange
was effected by means of labour notes, the usual means
of exchange and the usual middlemen being alike
superseded. The word ‘socialism’ first became current
in the discussions of the Association of all Classes of all
Nations, formed by Owen in 1835.</p>

<p>During these years also his secularistic teaching
gained such influence among the working classes as to
give occasion, in 1839, for the statement in the <span class='it'>Westminster
Review</span> that his principles were the actual creed
of a great portion of them. His views on marriage,
which were certainly lax, gave just ground for offence.
At this period some more communistic experiments
were made, of which the most important were that at
Ralahine, in the county of Clare, Ireland, and that at
Tytherly, in Hampshire. It is admitted that the former,
which was established in 1839, was a remarkable success
for three and a half years, till the proprietor, who
had granted the use of the land, having ruined himself
by gambling, was obliged to sell out. Tytherly, begun
in 1839, was an absolute failure. By 1846 the only
<span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span>
permanent result of Owen’s agitation, so zealously
carried on by public meetings, pamphlets, periodicals,
and occasional treatises, was the co-operative movement,
and for the time even that seemed to have
utterly collapsed. In his later years Owen became
a firm believer in spiritualism. He died in 1858 at
his native town at the age of eighty-seven.</p>

<p>The causes of Owen’s failure in establishing his
communities are obvious enough. Apart from the
difficulties inherent in socialism, he injured the social
cause by going out of his way to attack the historic
religions and the accepted views on marriage, by his
tediousness, quixotry, and over-confidence, by refusing
to see that for the mass of men measures of transition
from an old to a new system must be adopted. If he
had been truer to his earlier methods and retained the
autocratic guidance of his experiments, the chances of
success would have been greater. Above all, Owen had
too great faith in human nature, and he did not understand
the laws of social evolution. His great doctrine
of the influence of circumstances in the formation of
character was only a very crude way of expressing the
law of social continuity so much emphasised by recent
socialism. He thought that he could break the chain of
continuity, and as by magic create a new set of circumstances,
which would forthwith produce a new
generation of rational and unselfish men. The time
was too strong for him, and the current of English
history swept past him.</p>

<p>Even a very brief account of Owen, however, would
<span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span>
be incomplete without indicating his relation to
Malthus. Against Malthus he showed that the wealth
of the country had, in consequence of mechanical
improvement, increased out of all proportion to the
population. The problem, therefore, was not to restrict
population, but to institute rational social arrangements
and to secure a fair distribution of wealth.
Whenever the number of inhabitants in any of his
communities increased beyond the maximum, new ones
should be created, until they should extend over the whole
world. There would be no fear of over-population for
a long time to come. Its evils were then felt in Ireland
and other countries; but that condition of things was
owing to the total want of the most ordinary common
sense on the part of the blinded authorities of the
world. The period would probably never arrive when
the earth would be full; but, if it should, the human
race would be good, intelligent, and rational, and would
know much better than the present irrational generation
how to provide for the occurrence. Such was
Owen’s socialistic treatment of the population problem.</p>

<p>Robert Owen was essentially a pioneer, whose work
and influence it would be unjust to measure by their
tangible results. Apart from his socialistic theories, it
should, nevertheless, be remembered that he was one of
the foremost and most energetic promoters of many
movements of acknowledged and enduring usefulness.
He was the founder of infant schools in England; he
was the first to introduce reasonably short hours into
factory labour, and zealously promoted factory legislation—one
<span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span>
of the most needed and most beneficial
reforms of the century; and he was the real founder of
the co-operative movement. In general education, in
sanitary reform, and in his sound and humanitarian
views of common life, he was far in advance of his
time. Like Fourier, also, he did the great service of
calling attention to the advantages which might be
obtained in the social development of the future from
the reorganisation of the commune, or self-governing
local group of workers.</p>

<p>Still, he had many serious faults; all that was
quixotic, crude, and superficial in his views became
more prominent in his later years, and by the extravagance
of his advocacy of them he did vital injury to
the cause he had at heart. In his personal character he
was without reproach—frank, benevolent, and straightforward
to a fault; and he pursued the altruistic
schemes in which he spent all his means with more
earnestness than most men devote to the accumulation
of a fortune.</p>

<p>In England the reform of 1832 had the same effect
as the revolution of July (1830) in France: it brought
the middle class into power, and by the exclusion of the
workmen emphasised their existence as a separate class.
The discontent of the workmen now found expression
in Chartism. As is obvious from the contents of the
Charter, Chartism was most prominently a demand
for political reform; but both in its origin and in its
ultimate aim the movement was more essentially
economic. As regards the study of socialism, the
<span class='pageno' title='71' id='Page_71'></span>
interest of this movement lies greatly in the fact that
in its organs the doctrine of ‘surplus value,’ afterwards
elaborated by Marx as the basis of his system, is broadly
and emphatically enunciated. While the worker produces
all the wealth, he is obliged to content himself
with the meagre share necessary to support his existence,
and the surplus goes to the capitalist, who, with
the king, the priests, lords, esquires, and gentlemen,
lives upon the labour of the working man (<span class='it'>Poor Man’s
Guardian</span>, 1835).</p>

<p>After the downfall of Owenism began the Christian
socialist movement in England (1848-52), of which the
leaders were Maurice, Kingsley, and Mr. Ludlow. The
abortive Chartist demonstration of April 1848 excited
in Maurice and his friends the deepest sympathy with
the sufferings of the English working class—a feeling
which was intensified by the revelations regarding
‘London Labour and the London Poor’ published in the
<span class='it'>Morning Chronicle</span> in 1849. Mr. Ludlow, who had in
France become acquainted with the theories of Fourier,
was the economist of the movement, and it was with
him that the idea originated of starting co-operative
associations.</p>

<p>In <span class='it'>Politics for the People</span>, in the <span class='it'>Christian Socialist</span>, in
the pulpit and on the platform, and in <span class='it'>Yeast</span> and <span class='it'>Alton
Locke</span>, well-known novels of Kingsley, the representatives
of the movement exposed the evils of the competitive
system, carried on an unsparing warfare against
the Manchester School, and maintained that socialism,
rightly understood, was only Christianity applied to
<span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span>
social reform. Their labours in insisting on ethical
and spiritual principles as the true bonds of society, in
promoting associations, and in diffusing a knowledge of
co-operation, were largely beneficial. In the north of
England they joined hands with the co-operative movement
inaugurated by the Rochdale pioneers in 1844
under the influence of Owenism. Productive co-operation
made very little progress, but co-operative
distribution soon proved a great success.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br/><br/><span class='it'>FERDINAND LASSALLE</span></h2>

<h3><span class='sc'>I. Life</span></h3>

<p>In 1852 the twofold socialist movement in France
and England had come to an end, leaving no visible
result of any importance. From that date the most
prominent leaders of socialism have been German and
Russian.</p>

<p>German socialists also played a part in the revolution
of 1848 and in the years that preceded it; but as the
work that makes their names really historical was not
performed till a later period, we have postponed the
consideration of it till now, when we can treat it as
a whole. The most conspicuous chiefs of German socialism
have been Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Lassalle,
and Rodbertus. Of these, Lassalle<a id='r1_7'/><a href='#f1_7' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a> was the first to
make his mark in history as the originator of the Social
Democratic movement in Germany.</p>

<p>Ferdinand Lassalle was born at Breslau in 1825.</p>

<p><span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span></p>

<p>Like Karl Marx, the chief of international socialism,
he was of Jewish extraction. His father, a prosperous
merchant in Breslau, intended Ferdinand for a business
career, and with this view sent him to the commercial
school at Leipsic; but the boy, having no liking for
that kind of life, got himself transferred to the university,
first at Breslau, and afterwards at Berlin. His
favourite studies were philology and philosophy; he
became an ardent Hegelian, and in politics was one of
the most advanced. Having completed his university
studies in 1845, he began to write a work on <span class='it'>Heracleitus</span>
from the Hegelian point of view; but it was soon
interrupted by more stirring interests, and did not see
the light for many years.</p>

<p>From the Rhine country, where he settled for a time,
he went to Paris, and made the acquaintance of his
great compatriot Heine, who conceived for him the
deepest sympathy and admiration. In the letter of
introduction to Varnhagen von Ense, which the poet
gave Lassalle when he returned to Berlin, there is a
striking portrait of the future agitator. Heine speaks
of his friend Lassalle as a young man of the most
remarkable endowments, in whom the widest knowledge,
the greatest acuteness, and the richest gifts of
expression are combined with an energy and practical
ability which excite his astonishment; but adds, in his
half-mocking way, that he is a genuine son of the new
era, without even the pretence of modesty or self-denial,
who will assert and enjoy himself in the world of realities.
At Berlin, Lassalle became a favourite in some
<span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span>
of the most distinguished circles; even the veteran
Humboldt was fascinated by him, and used to call him
the <span class='it'>Wunderkind</span>.</p>

<p>Here it was also, early in 1846, that he met the lady
with whom his life was to be associated in so striking a
way, the Countess Hatzfeldt. She had been separated
from her husband for many years, and was at feud with
him on questions of property and the custody of their
children. With characteristic energy Lassalle adopted
the cause of the countess, whom he believed to have
been outrageously wronged, made a special study of law,
and, after bringing the case before thirty-six tribunals,
reduced the powerful count to a compromise on terms
most favourable to his client.</p>

<p>The process, which lasted eight years, gave rise to
not a little scandal, especially that of the <span class='it'>Cassettengeschichte</span>.
This ‘affair of the casket’ arose out of an
attempt by the countess’s friends to get possession of a
bond for a large life-annuity settled by the count on
his mistress, a Baroness Meyendorf, to the prejudice
of the countess and her children. At the instigation
of Lassalle, two of his comrades succeeded in carrying
off a casket, which was supposed to contain the document
in question (but which really contained her
jewels), from the baroness’s room at a hotel in Cologne.
They were prosecuted for theft, one of them being
condemned to six months’ imprisonment. Lassalle
himself was accused of moral complicity, but was
acquitted on appeal.</p>

<p>His intimate relations with the countess, which continued
<span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span>
till the end, certainly did not tend to improve
Lassalle’s position in German society. Rightly or
wrongly, people had an unfavourable impression of him,
as of an adventurer. Here we can but say that he
claimed to act from the noblest motives; in the individual
lot and suffering of the countess he saw the
social misery of the time reflected, and his assertion of
her cause was a moral insurrection against it. While
the case was pending, he gave the countess a share of
his allowance from his father; and after it was won,
he received according to agreement, from the now
ample resources of the lady, an annual income of four
thousand thalers (£600). Added to his own private
means, this sum placed the finances of Lassalle on a
sure footing for the rest of his life. His conduct was a
mixture of chivalry and business, which every one must
judge for himself. It was certainly not in accordance
with the conventionalities, but for these Lassalle never
entertained much respect.</p>

<p>In 1848 Lassalle attached himself to the group of
men, Karl Marx, Engels, Freiligrath, and others, who
in the Rhine country represented the socialistic and
extreme democratic side of the revolution, and whose
organ was the <span class='it'>New Rhenish Gazette</span>. But the activity
of Lassalle was only local and subordinate. He was,
however, condemned to six months’ imprisonment for
resisting the authorities at Dusseldorf. On that occasion
Lassalle prepared the first of those speeches
which made so great an impression on the men of
his time; but it was not delivered. It contains the
<span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span>
first important statement of his social and political
opinions. ‘I will always joyfully confess,’ he said,
‘that from inner conviction I am a decided adherent of
the Social Democratic republic.’</p>

<p>Till 1858 Lassalle resided mostly in the Rhine
country, prosecuting the suit of his friend the countess,
and afterwards completing his work on Heracleitus,
which was published in that year. He was not allowed
to live in Berlin because of his connection with the
disturbances of 1848. In 1859 he returned to the
capital disguised as a carter, and finally, through the
influence of Humboldt with the king, received permission
to remain.</p>

<p>In the same year he published a remarkable
pamphlet on <span class='it'>The Italian War and the Mission of
Prussia</span>, in which he came forward to warn his countrymen
against going to the rescue of Austria in her war
with France. He argued that if France drove Austria
out of Italy she might annex Savoy, but could not
prevent the restoration of Italian unity under Victor
Emmanuel. France was doing the work of Germany
by weakening Austria, the great cause of German
disunion and weakness; Prussia should form an alliance
with France in order to drive out Austria and make
herself supreme in Germany. After their realisation
by Bismarck, these ideas have become sufficiently
commonplace; but they were nowise obvious when
thus published by Lassalle. In this, as in other
matters, he showed that he possessed both the insight
and foresight of a statesman.
<span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span></p>

<p>In the course of the Hatzfeldt suit Lassalle had
acquired no little knowledge of law, which proved
serviceable to him in the great work, <span class='it'>System of Acquired
Rights</span>, published in 1861. The book professes to be,
and in a great measure is, an application of the
historical method to legal ideas and institutions; but
it is largely dominated also by abstract conceptions,
which are not really drawn from history, but read into
it. The results of his investigation are sufficiently
revolutionary; in the legal sphere they go even farther
than his socialistic writings in the economic and
political. But with one important exception he made
no attempt to base his socialistic agitation on his
<span class='it'>System of Acquired Rights</span>; it simply remained a learned
work.</p>

<p>Hitherto Lassalle had been known only as the author
of two learned works, and as connected with one of the
most extraordinary lawsuits of the nineteenth century,
which had become a widespread scandal. Now began
the brief activity which was to give him an historical
significance. His revolutionary activity in 1848, though
only a short phase in his career, was not an accident;
it represented a permanent feature of his character. In
him the student and the man of action were combined
in a notable manner, but the craving for effective
action was eminently strong. The revolutionary and
the active elements in his strangely mixed nature had
for want of an opportunity been for many years in
abeyance.</p>

<p>A rare opportunity had at last come for asserting
<span class='pageno' title='79' id='Page_79'></span>
his old convictions. In the struggle between the
Prussian Government and the Opposition he saw an
opportunity for vindicating a great cause, that of the
working men, which would outflank the Liberalism of
the middle classes, and might command the sympathy
and respect of the Government. But his political
programme was entirely subordinate to the social, that
of bettering the condition of the working classes; and
he believed that as their champion he might have such
influence in the Prussian State as to determine it on
entering on a great career of social amelioration.</p>

<p>The social activity of Lassalle dates from the year
1862. It was a time of new life in Germany. The
forces destined to transform the Germany of Hegel into
the Germany of Bismarck were preparing. The time
for the restoration and unification of the Fatherland
under the leadership of Prussia had come. The nation
that had so long been foremost in philosophy and
theory was to take a leading place in the practical
walks of national life, in war and politics, and in the
modern methods of industry. The man who died as first
German Emperor of the new order ascended the throne
of Prussia in 1861. Bismarck, whose mission it was to
take the chief part in this great transformation, entered
on the scene as Chief Minister of Prussia in the autumn
of 1862. The Progressist party, that phase of German
Liberalism which was to offer such bitter opposition
both to Bismarck and Lassalle, came into existence in
1861.</p>

<p>For accomplishing this world-historic change the
<span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span>
decisive factor was the Prussian army. The new rulers
of Prussia clearly saw that for the success of their plans
everything would depend on the efficiency of the army.
But on the question of its reorganisation they came
into conflict with the Liberals, who, failing to comprehend
the policy of Bismarck, refused him the supplies
necessary for realising ideals dear to every German
patriot.</p>

<p>In the controversy so bitterly waged between the
Prussian monarchy and the Liberals, Lassalle intervened.
As might be expected, he was not a man to be bound by
the formulas of Prussian Liberalism, and in a lecture,
<span class='it'>On the Nature of a Constitution</span>, delivered early in 1862,
he expounded views entirely at variance with them.
In this lecture his aim was to show that a constitution
is not a theory or a document written on paper; it is
the expression of the strongest political forces of the
time. The king, the nobility, the middle class, the
working class, all these are forces in the polity of
Prussia; but the strongest of all is the king, who possesses
in the army a means of political power, which
is organised, excellently disciplined, always at hand,
and always ready to march. The army is the basis of
the actual working constitution of Prussia. In the
struggle against a Government resting on such a basis,
verbal protests and compromises were of no avail.</p>

<p>In a second lecture, <span class='it'>What Next?</span>, Lassalle proceeded
to maintain that there was only one method for
effectually resisting the Government, to proclaim the
facts of the political situation as they were, and then
<span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span>
to retire from the Chamber. By remaining they only
gave a false appearance of legality to the doings of the
Government. If they withdrew it must yield, as in
the present state of political opinion in Prussia and in
civilised Europe no Government could exist in defiance
of the wishes of the people.</p>

<p>In a pamphlet subsequently published under the
title of <span class='it'>Might and Right</span>, Lassalle defended himself
against the accusation that in these lectures he had
subordinated the claims of Right to those of Force.
He had, he said, not been expressing his own views of
what ought to be; he had simply been elucidating facts
in an historical way, he had only been explaining the
real nature of the situation. He now went on to
declare that no one in the Prussian State had any right
to speak of Right but the old and genuine democracy.
It had always cleaved to the Right, degrading itself by
no compromise with power. With the democracy alone
is Right, and with it alone will be Might.</p>

<p>We need not say that these utterances of Lassalle
had no influence on the march of events. The rulers
pushed on the reorganising of the army with supplies
obtained without the consent of the Prussian Chambers,
the Liberal members protesting in vain till the great
victory over Austria in 1866 furnished an ample justification
for the policy of Bismarck.</p>

<p>But their publication marked an important crisis in
his own career, for they did not recommend him to the
favourable consideration of the German Liberals with
whom he had previously endeavoured to act. He and
<span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span>
they never had much sympathy for one another. They
were fettered by formulas as well as wanting in energy
and initiative. On the other hand, his adventurous
career; his temperament, which disposed him to rebel
against the conventionalities and formulas generally;
his loyalty to the extreme democracy of 1848, all brought
him into disharmony with the current Liberalism of his
time. They gave him no tokens of their confidence,
and he chose a path of his own.</p>

<p>A more decisive step in a new direction was taken in
1862 by his lecture, <span class='it'>The Working-Men’s Programme; On
the special Connection of the Present Epoch of History with
the Idea of the Working Class</span>. The gist of this lecture
was to show that we are now entering on a new era of
history, of which the working class are the makers and
representatives. It is a masterly performance, lucid in
style, and scientific in method of treatment. Yet this
did not save its author from the attentions of the
Prussian police. Lassalle was brought to trial on the
charge of exciting the poor against the rich, and in
spite of an able defence, published under the title of
<span class='it'>Science and the Workers</span>, he was condemned to four
months’ imprisonment. But he appealed, and on the
second hearing of the case made such an impression on
the judges that the sentence was commuted into a fine
of £15.</p>

<p>Such proceedings naturally brought Lassalle into
prominence as the exponent of a new way of thinking
on social and political subjects. A section of the
working men were, like himself, discontented with the
<span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span>
current German Liberalism. The old democracy of
1848 was beginning to awake from the apathy and
lassitude consequent on the failures of that troubled
period. Men imbued with the traditions and aspirations
of such a time could not be satisfied with the
half-hearted programme of the Progressists, who would
not decide on adopting universal suffrage as part of
their policy, yet wished to utilise the workmen for
their own ends. A Liberalism which had not the
courage to be frankly democratic, could only be a
temporary and unsatisfactory phase of political development.</p>

<p>This discontent found expression at Leipsic, where a
body of workmen, displeased with the Progressists, yet
undecided as to any clear line of policy, had formed a
Central Committee for the calling together of a Working
Men’s Congress. With Lassalle, they had common
ground in their discontent with the Progressists, and
to him in 1863 they applied, in the hope that he might
suggest a definite line of action. Lassalle replied in an
<span class='it'>Open Letter</span>, with a political and social-economic programme,
which, for lucidity and comprehensiveness of
statement, left nothing to be desired. In the <span class='it'>Working
Men’s Programme</span>, Lassalle had drawn the rough outlines
of a new historic period, in which the interests of
labour should be paramount; in the <span class='it'>Open Letter</span> he
expounds the political, social, and economic principles
which should guide the working men in inaugurating
the new era. The <span class='it'>Open Letter</span> has well been called the
Charter of German Socialism. It was the first historic
<span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'></span>
act in a new stage of social development. We need
not say that it marked the definite rupture of Lassalle
with German Liberalism.</p>

<p>In the <span class='it'>Open Letter</span> the guiding principles of the
Social Democratic agitation of Lassalle are given with
absolute clearness and decision: that the working men
should form an independent political party—one, however,
in which the political programme should be
entirely subordinated to the great social end of improving
the condition of their class; that the schemes
of Schulze-Delitzsch<a id='r2_7'/><a href='#f2_7' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a> for this end were inadequate;
that the operation of the iron law of wages prevented
any real improvement under the existing conditions;
that productive associations, by which, the workmen
should secure the full product of their labour, should
be established by the State, founded on universal
suffrage, and therefore truly representative of the
people. The Leipsic Committee accepted the policy
thus sketched, and invited him to address them in
person. After hearing him the meeting voted in his
favour by a majority of 1300 against 7.</p>

<p>A subsequent appearance at Frankfort-on-the-Main
was even more flattering to Lassalle. In that as in
most other towns of Germany the workmen were
generally disposed to support Schulze and the Progressist
<span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span>
party. Lassalle therefore had the hard task
of conciliating and gaining a hearing from a hostile
audience. His first speech, four hours in length, met
at times with a stormy reception, and was frequently
interrupted. Yet he gained the sympathy of his
audience by his eloquence and the intrinsic interest of
his matter, and the applause increased as he went
on. When, two days afterwards, he addressed them
a second time, the assembly voted for Lassalle by 400
to 40. It was really a great triumph. Like Napoleon,
he had, he said, beaten the enemy with their own
troops. On the following day he addressed a meeting
at Mainz, where 700 workmen unanimously declared in
his favour.</p>

<p>These successes seemed to justify Lassalle in taking
the decisive step of his agitation—the foundation of
the Universal German Working Men’s Association,
which followed at Leipsic on May 23, 1863. Its programme
was a simple one, containing only one point—universal
suffrage. ‘Proceeding from the conviction
that only through equal and direct universal suffrage<a id='r3_7'/><a href='#f3_7' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a>
can a sufficient representation of the social interests
of the German working class and a real removal of
class antagonisms in society be realised, the Association
pursues the aim, in a peaceful and legal way, especially
by winning over public opinion, to work for the establishment
of equal and direct universal suffrage.’</p>

<p><span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span></p>

<p>Hitherto Lassalle had been an isolated individual
expressing on his own responsibility an opinion on the
topics of the day. He was elected President, for five
years, of the newly founded Association, and was therefore
the head of a new movement. He had crossed the
Rubicon, not without hesitation and misgiving.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1863 little was accomplished.
The membership of the Association grew but slowly,
and, according to his wont, Lassalle retired to the baths
to recruit his health. In the autumn he renewed his
agitation by a ‘review’ of his forces on the Rhine,
where the workmen were most enthusiastic in his
favour. But the severest crisis of his agitation befell
during the winter of 1863-4. At this period his labours
were almost more than human; he wrote his <span class='it'>Bastiat-Schulze</span>,<a id='r4_7'/><a href='#f4_7' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[4]</span></sup></a>
a considerable treatise, in about three months,
defended himself before the courts both of Berlin and
the Rhine in elaborate speeches, conducted the affairs
of his Association in all their troublesome details, and
often before stormy and hostile audiences gave a succession
of addresses, the aim of which was the conquest of
Berlin.</p>

<p>Lassalle’s <span class='it'>Bastiat-Schulze</span>, his largest economic work,
bears all the marks of the haste and feverishness of the
time that gave it birth. It contains passages in the
worst possible taste; the coarseness and scurrility of
his treatment of Schulze are absolutely unjustifiable.
The book consists of barren and unprofitable controversy,
<span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span>
interspersed with philosophic statements of his
economic position, and even they are often crude, confused,
and exaggerated. Controversy is usually the
most unsatisfactory department of literature, and of
the various forms of controversy that of Lassalle is the
least to be desired, consisting as it so largely did of
supercilious verbal and captious objection. The book
as a whole is far below the level of the <span class='it'>Working Men’s
Programme</span> and the <span class='it'>Open Letter</span>.</p>

<p>After all these labours little wonder that we find him
writing, on the 14th of February: ‘I am tired to death,
and strong as my constitution is, it is shaking to the
core. My excitement is so great that I can no longer
sleep at night; I toss about on my bed till five o’clock,
and rise up with aching head, and entirely exhausted.
I am overworked, overtasked, and overtired in the
frightfullest degree; the mad effort, beside my other
labours, to finish the <span class='it'>Bastiat-Schulze</span> in three months,
the profound and painful disappointment, the cankering
inner disgust, caused by the indifference and apathy of
the working class taken as a whole—all has been too
much even for me.’</p>

<p>Clearly the great agitator needed rest, and he decided
to seek it, as usual, at the baths. But before he retired,
he desired once more to refresh his weary soul in the
sympathetic enthusiasm which he anticipated from his
devoted adherents on the Rhine. Accordingly, on the
8th May 1864, Lassalle departed for the ‘glorious review
of his army’ in the Rhine country. ‘He spoke,’
Mehring tells us, ‘on May 14th at Solingen, on the
<span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span>
15th at Barmen, on the 16th at Cologne, on the 18th
at Wermelskirchen.’ His journey was like a royal
progress or a triumphal procession, except that the joy
of the people was perfectly spontaneous. Thousands
of workmen received him with acclamations; crowds
pressed upon him to shake hands with him, to exchange
friendly greetings with him.</p>

<p>On the 22nd May, the first anniversary festival of
the Universal Association, held at Ronsdorf, the enthusiasm
reached its climax. Old and young, men and
women, went forth to meet him as he approached the
town; and he entered it through triumphal arches,
under a deluge of flowers thrown from the hands of
working girls, amidst jubilation indescribable. Writing
to the Countess of Hatzfeldt about this time of the
impression made on his mind by his reception on the
Rhine, Lassalle says, ‘I had the feeling that such
scenes must have been witnessed at the founding of
new religions.’</p>

<p>The speech of Lassalle at Ronsdorf corresponded in
character with the enthusiasm and exaltation of such a
time and such an audience. The King of Prussia had
recently listened with favour to the grievances of a
deputation of Silesian weavers, and promised to help
them out of his own purse. Von Ketteler, Bishop of
Mainz, had published a short treatise, in which he
expressed his agreement with Lassalle’s criticism of the
existing economic system. As his manner was, Lassalle
did not under-estimate the value of those expressions
of opinion. ‘We have compelled,’ he declared, ‘the
<span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'></span>
workmen, the people, the bishops, the king, to bear
testimony to the truth of our principles.’</p>

<p>It would be easy to ridicule the enthusiasm for
Lassalle entertained by those workmen on the Rhine,
but it will be more profitable if we pause for a moment
to realise the world-historic pathos of the scene. For
the first time for many centuries we see the working
men of Germany aroused from their hereditary degradation,
apathy, and hopelessness. Change after change
had passed in the higher sphere of politics. One conqueror
after another had traversed these Rhine countries,
but, whoever lost or won, it was the working man who
had to pay with his sweat and toil and sorrow. He
was the anvil on which the hammer of those iron times
had fallen without mercy and without intermission.
His doom it was to drudge, to be fleeced, to be drilled
and marched off to fight battles in which he had no
interest. Brief and fitful gleams of a wild and desperate
hope had visited these poor people before, only to go
out again in utter darkness; but now in a sky which
had so long been black and dull with monotonous
misery, the rays were discernible of approaching dawn,
a shining light which would grow into a more perfect
day. For in the process of history the time had come
when the suffering which had so long been dumb should
find a voice that would be heard over the world, should
find an organisation that would compel the attention of
rulers and all men.</p>

<p>Such a cause can be most effectually furthered by
wise and sane leadership: yet it is also well when it is
<span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>
not too dependent on the guidance of those who seek to
control it. The career of Lassalle always had its unpleasant
features. He liked the passing effect too well.
He was too fond of display and pleasure. In much
that he did there is a note of exaggeration, bordering
on insincerity. As his agitation proceeded, this feature
of his character becomes more marked. Some of his
addresses to the workmen remind us too forcibly of the
bulletins of the first Napoleon. He was not always
careful to have the firm ground of fact and reality
beneath his feet. Many of his critics speak of the
failure of his agitation; with no good reason, considering
how short a time it had continued, hardly more
than a year. Lassalle himself was greatly disappointed
with the comparatively little success he had attained.
He had not the patience to wait till the sure operation
of truth and fact and the justice of the cause he fought
for should bring him the reward it merited. On all
these grounds we cannot consider the event which so
unworthily closed his life as an accident; it was the
melancholy outcome of the weaker elements in his
strangely mixed character.</p>

<p>While posing as the spokesman of the poor, Lassalle
was a man of decidedly fashionable and luxurious
habits. His suppers were well known as among the
most exquisite in Berlin. It was the most piquant
feature of his life that he, one of the gilded youth, a
connoisseur in wines, and a learned man to boot, had
become agitator and the champion of the workers. In
one of the literary and fashionable circles of Berlin he
<span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span>
had met a young lady, a Fräulein von Dönniges, for
whom he at once felt a passion which was ardently
reciprocated. He met her again on the Rigi, in the
summer of 1864, when they resolved to marry. She
was a young lady of twenty, decidedly unconventional
and original in character. It would appear from her
own confession that she had not always respected the
sacred German morality.</p>

<p>But she had for father a Bavarian diplomatist then
resident in Geneva, who was angry beyond all bounds
when he heard of the proposed match, and would have
absolutely nothing to do with Lassalle. The lady was
imprisoned in her own room, and soon, apparently under
the influence of very questionable pressure, renounced
Lassalle in favour of another admirer, a Wallachian,
Count von Racowitza. Lassalle, who had resorted to
every available means to gain his end, was now mad
with rage, and sent a challenge both to the lady’s father
and her betrothed, which was accepted by the latter.
At the Carouge, a suburb of Geneva, the meeting took
place on the morning of August 28, 1864. Lassalle
was mortally wounded, and died on the 31st of the
same month. In spite of such a foolish ending, his
funeral was that of a martyr, and by many of his adherents
he has since been regarded with feelings almost
of religious devotion.</p>

<p>How the career of Lassalle might have shaped itself
in the new Germany under the system of universal
suffrage which was adopted only three years after his
death, is an interesting subject of speculation. He
<span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span>
could not have remained inactive, and he certainly
would not have been hindered by <span class='it'>doctrinaire</span> scruples
from playing an effective part, even though it were
by some kind of alliance with the Government. His
ambition and his energy were alike boundless. In the
heyday of his passion for Fräulein von Dönniges his
dream was to be installed as the President of the
German Republic with her elevated by his side. As it
was, his position at his death was rapidly becoming
difficult and even untenable; he was involved in a net
of prosecutions which were fast closing round him.
He would soon have had no alternative but exile or a
prolonged imprisonment.</p>

<p>Lassalle was undoubtedly a man of the most extraordinary
endowments. The reader of his works feels
that he is in the presence of a mind of a very high order.
Both in his works and in his life we find an exceptional
combination of gifts, philosophic power, eloquence, enthusiasm,
practical energy, a dominating force of will.
Born of a cosmopolitan race, which has produced so
many men little trammelled by the conventionalism of
the old European societies, he was to a remarkable
degree original and free from social prejudice; was one
of the men in whom the spirit of daring initiative is to
a remarkable degree active. He had in fact a revolutionary
temperament, disciplined by the study of
German philosophy, by the sense of the greatness of
Prussia’s historic mission, and by a considerable measure
of practical insight, for in this he was not by any means
wanting. In Marx we see the same temperament, only
<span class='pageno' title='93' id='Page_93'></span>
in his case it was stronger, more solid, sell-restrained,
matured by wider reflection, and especially by the study
of the economic development of Europe, continued for a
period of forty years.</p>

<p>But on the whole, Lassalle was a <span class='it'>vis intemperata</span>. He
was deficient in sober-mindedness, self-control, and in
that saving gift of common sense, without which the
highest endowments may be unprofitable and even hurtful
to their possessors and to the world. His ambitions
were not pure; he had a histrionic as well as a revolutionary
temperament; he was lacking also in self-respect;
above all, he had not sufficient reverence for
the great and sacred cause of which he had become the
champion, a cause which is fitted to claim the highest
motives, the purest ambitions, the most noble enthusiasms.
His vanity, his want of self-restraint, his deficient
sense of the seriousness of his mission as a Social Democratic
leader, in these we see the failings that proved
his undoing. Throughout the miserable intrigue in
which he met his death a simple, straightforward sense
of what was right and becoming would at once have
saved him from ruin. Yet he was privileged to inaugurate
a great movement. As the founder of the Social
Democracy of Germany, he has earned a place on the
roll of historic names. He possessed in a notable
degree the originality, energy, and sympathy which fit
a man to be the champion of a new cause.</p>

<p>We may go further and say that at that date Germany
had only two men whose insight into the facts
and tendencies of their time was in some real degree
<span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span>
adequate to the occasion—Bismarck and Lassalle. The
former represented a historic cause, which was ready
for action, the regeneration and unification of Germany
to be accomplished by the Prussian army. The cause
which Lassalle brought to the front was at a very
different stage of progress. The working men, its promoters
and representatives, and Lassalle, its champion,
had not attained to anything like clearness either as to
the end to be gained or the means for accomplishing
it. It was only at the crudest and most confused
initial stage.

<h3><span class='sc'>II. Theories of Lassalle</span></h3>

<p>The socialistic position of Lassalle may generally be
described as similar to that of Rodbertus and Karl Marx.
He admits his indebtedness to both of those writers,
but at the same time he cannot be regarded as a disciple
of either of them. Lassalle himself was a thinker of
great original power; he had his own way of conceiving
and expressing the historic socialism.</p>

<p>Lassalle supplies the key to his general position in
the preface to his <span class='it'>Bastiat-Schulze</span>, when, quoting from
his <span class='it'>System of Acquired Rights</span>, he says: In social
matters the world is confronted with the question,
whether now when property in the direct utilisation of
another man no longer exists, such property in his indirect
exploitation should continue—that is, whether
the free realisation and development of our labour-force
should be the exclusive private property of the possessor
of capital, and whether the employer as such, and
apart from the remuneration of his intellectual labour,
should be permitted to appropriate the result of other
men’s labours.<a id='r1_8'/><a href='#f1_8' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a> This sentence, he says, contains the
programme of a national-economic work, which he intended
to write under the title, <span class='it'>Outlines of a Scientific
National Economy</span>. In this sentence also, we need not
say, the fundamental position of socialism is implied.
He was about to carry out his project when the Leipsic
<span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span>
Central Committee brought the question before him in
a practical form. The agitation broke out and left him
no leisure for such a work. But he had often lamented
that the exposition of the theory had not preceded the
practical agitation, and that a scientific basis had not
been provided for it.</p>

<p>The <span class='it'>Bastiat-Schulze</span> was itself a controversial work,
written to meet the needs of the hour. Lassalle has
never given a full and systematic exposition of his
socialistic theory. All his social-economic writings
were published as the crises of his agitation seemed to
demand. But, as he himself says, they compensate
by the life and incisiveness of the polemical form of
treatment for what they lose in systematic value. We
may add that it is often a scientific gain, for in the
career of Lassalle we see socialism confronted with fact,
and thereby to a large extent saved from the absoluteness,
abstractness, and deficient sense of reality which
detract so much from the value of the works of Marx
and Rodbertus. The excessive love of system so characteristic
of German theorists may be as remote from
historic reality and possibility as the utopian schemes
of French socialists. It is, however, also a natural
result of Lassalle’s mode of presentation that he is not
always consistent with himself either on practical or
theoretical questions, especially in his attitude towards
the Prussian State.</p>

<p>On the whole, we can most clearly and comprehensively
bring out the views of Lassalle if we follow the
order in which they are presented in his three leading
<span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span>
works, the <span class='it'>Working Men’s Programme</span>, the <span class='it'>Open Letter</span>,
and the <span class='it'>Bastiat-Schulze</span>.</p>

<p>The central theme of the <span class='it'>Working Men’s Programme</span>
is the <span class='it'>vocation of the working class</span> as the makers and
representatives of a new era in the history of the world.
We have seen that Lassalle’s <span class='it'>System of Acquired Rights</span>
was an application of the historical method to legal
ideas and institutions. In his social-economic writings
we find the application of the same method to economic
facts and institutions. The <span class='it'>Working Men’s Programme</span>
is a brilliant example of the historical method, and
indeed is a lucid review of the economic development
of Europe, culminating in the working men’s State, the
full-grown democracy.</p>

<p>In the mediæval world the owners of land controlled
politics, the army, law, and taxation in their
own interest, while labour was oppressed and despised.
The present <span class='it'>régime</span> of the capitalist classes is due
to a gradual process of development continued for
centuries, and is the product of many forces which
have acted and reacted on each other: the invention of
the mariner’s compass and of gunpowder; abroad the
discovery of America and of the sea-route to India; at
home the overthrow of the feudal houses by a central
government, which established a regular justice, security
of property, and better means of communication. This
was to be followed in time by the development of
machinery, like the cotton-spinning machine of Arkwright,
itself the living embodiment of the industrial
and economic revolution, which was destined to
<span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span>
produce a corresponding political change. The new
machinery, the large industry, the division of labour,
cheap goods, and the world-market—these were all
parts of an organic whole. Production in mass made
cheap goods possible; the cheapening of commodities
called forth a wider market, and the wider market led
to a still larger production.</p>

<p>The rulers of the industrial world, the capitalists,
became the rulers also of the political; the French
Revolution was merely a proclamation of a mighty fact
which had already established itself in the most advanced
portions of Europe. But the marvellous enthusiasm
of the Revolution was kindled by the fact
that its champions at the time represented the cause of
humanity. Before long, however, it became manifest
that the new rulers fought for the interests of a class,
the <span class='it'>bourgeoisie</span>; and another class, that of the proletariat,
or unpropertied workers, began to define itself
in opposition to them. Like their predecessors, the
<span class='it'>bourgeoisie</span> wielded the legal and political power for
their own selfish ends. They made wealth the test
and basis of political and social right; they established
a restricted franchise; shackled the free expression of
opinion by cautions and taxes on newspapers, and threw
the burden of taxation on the working classes.</p>

<p>We have seen that the development of the middle
class was a slow and gradual process, the complex
result of a complex mass of forces. Considering that
the special theme of the <span class='it'>Working Men’s Programme</span> is
the historical function of the working class, it is certainly
<span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span>
a most serious defect of Lassalle’s exposition that
he says so little of the causes which have conditioned
the development of the working class as the representatives
of a new era. Their appearance on the pages of
Lassalle as the supporters of a great <span class='it'>rôle</span> is far too sudden.</p>

<p>On the 24th of February 1848, he says, broke the
first dawn of a new historical period. On that day in
France a revolution broke out, which called a workman
into the Provisional Government; which declared the
aim of the State to be the improvement of the lot of
the working class; and which proclaimed direct and
universal suffrage, whereby every citizen who had
attained the age of twenty-one should, without regard
to property, have an equal share in all political activity.
The working class were therefore destined to be the
rulers and makers of a new society. But the rule of
the working class had this enormous difference from
other forms of class rule, that it admits of no special
privilege.</p>

<p>We are all workers, in so far as we have the will in
any way to make ourselves useful to the human society.
The working class is therefore identical with the whole
human race. Its cause is in truth the cause of entire
humanity, its freedom is the freedom of humanity itself,
its rule is the rule of all.</p>

<p>The formal means of realising this is direct universal
suffrage, which is no magic wand, but which at least
can rectify its own mistakes. It is the lance which
heals the wounds itself has made. Under universal
suffrage the legislature is the true mirror of the people
<span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span>
that has chosen it, reflecting its defects, but its progress
also, for which it affords unlimited expression and
development.</p>

<p>The people must therefore always regard direct
universal suffrage as its indispensable political weapon,
as the most fundamental and weightiest of its demands.
And we need not fear that they will abuse their power;
for while the position and interests of the old privileged
classes became inconsistent with the general progress
of humanity, the mass of the people must know that
their interests can be advanced only by promoting the
good of their whole class. Even a very moderate sense
of their own welfare must teach them that each individual
can separately do very little to improve his
condition. They can prevail only by union. Thus
their personal interest, instead of being opposed to the
movement of history, coincides with the development
of the whole people and is in harmony with freedom,
culture, and the highest ideas of our time.</p>

<p>This masterly treatise of Lassalle concludes with an
appeal to the working class, in which we see the great
agitator reach the high level of a pure and noble
eloquence. Having shown at length that the working
class are called to be the creators and representatives
of a new historical era, he proceeds: ‘From what we
have said there follows for all who belong to the working
class the duty of an entirely new bearing.</p>

<p>‘Nothing is more suited to stamp on a class a worthy
and deeply moral impress than the consciousness that
it is called to be the ruling class, that it is appointed
<span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'></span>
to raise its principle to be the principle of an entire
epoch, to make its idea the ruling idea of the whole
society, and so again to mould society after its own
pattern. The high world-historic honour of this vocation
must occupy all your thoughts. The vices of the
oppressed, the idle amusements of the thoughtless, and
the harmless frivolity of the unimportant beseem you
no longer. Ye are the rock on which the church of the
future should be built.’</p>

<p>Pity that in the miserable squabble which terminated
his life he did not realise that the leader of the working
class should also be inspired by a sense of the
nobility of his calling.</p>

<p>This exposition of the vocation of the working
class is closely connected with another notable feature
of Lassalle’s teaching, his <span class='it'>Theory of the State</span>. Lassalle’s
theory of the State differs entirely from that generally
held by the Liberal school. The Liberal school hold
that the function of the State consists simply in protecting
the personal freedom and the property of the
individual. This he scouts as a night-watchman’s idea,
because it conceives the State under the image of a
night-watchman, whose sole function it is to prevent
robbery and burglary.</p>

<p>In opposition to this narrow idea of the State, Lassalle
quotes approvingly the view of August Boeckh: ‘That
we must widen our notion of the State so as to believe
that the State is the institution in which the whole
virtue of humanity should be realised.’</p>

<p>History, Lassalle tells us, is an incessant struggle
<span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span>
with Nature, with the misery, ignorance, poverty, weakness,
and unfreedom in which the human race was
originally placed.<a id='r2_8'/><a href='#f2_8' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a> The progressive victory over this
weakness, that is the development of the freedom
which history depicts.</p>

<p>In this struggle, if the individual had been left to
himself, he could have made no progress. The State it
is which has the function to accomplish this development
of freedom, this development of the human race
in the way of freedom. The duty of the State is to
enable the individual to reach a sum of culture, power,
and freedom, which for individuals would be absolutely
unattainable. The aim of the State is to bring human
nature to positive unfolding and progressive development—in
other words, to realise the chief end of man:
it is the education and development of the human race
in the way of freedom.</p>

<p>The State should be the complement of the individual.
It must be ready to offer a helping hand,
wherever and whenever individuals are unable to
realise the happiness, freedom, and culture which befit
a human being.</p>

<p>Save the State, that primitive vestal fire of culture,
from the modern barbarians, he exclaims on another
occasion.</p>

<p>To these political conceptions Lassalle is true throughout.
It certainly is a nobler and more rational ideal of
the State than the once prevalent Manchester theory.
When we descend from theory to practice all obviously
<span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span>
depends on what kind of State we have got, and on the
circumstances and conditions under which it is called
upon to act.</p>

<p>That the State should, through its various organs,
support and develop individual effort, calling it forth,
rendering it hopeful and effectual, never weakening the
springs of it, but stimulating and completing it, is a
position which most thinkers would now accept. And
most will admit with regret that the existing State is
too much a great taxing and fighting machine. The
field of inquiry here opened up is a wide and tempting
one, on which we cannot now enter. We are at present
concerned with the fact that the State help contemplated
by Lassalle was meant not only to leave the
individual free, but to further him in the free realisation
of himself.</p>

<p>The <span class='it'>Iron Law of Wages</span> may well be described as
the key to Lassalle’s social-economic position. It holds
the same prominent place in his system of thinking as
the theory of surplus value does in that of Marx.
Both, it may be added, are only different aspects of the
same fact. Lassalle insists chiefly on the small share
of the produce of labour which goes to the labourer;
Marx traces the history of the share, called surplus
value, which goes to the capitalist.</p>

<p>Lassalle’s most careful statement of the Iron Law, to
which he frequently recurs in subsequent writings, is
contained in his <span class='it'>Open Letter</span> (p. 13). ‘The Iron Economic
Law, which, in existing circumstances, under
the law of supply and demand for labour, determines
<span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span>
the wage, is this: that the average wage always
remains reduced to the necessary provision which,
according to the customary standard of living, is required
for subsistence and for propagation. This is
the point about which the real wage continually oscillates,
without ever being able long to rise above it or
to fall below it. It cannot permanently rise above this
average level, because in consequence of the easier and
better condition of the workers there would be an
increase of marriages and births among them, an increase
of the working population and thereby of the
supply of labour, which would bring the wage down to
its previous level or even below it. On the other
hand, the wage cannot permanently fall below this
necessary subsistence, because then occur emigration,
abstinence from marriage, and, lastly, a diminution of
the number of workmen caused by their misery, which
lessens the supply of labour, and therefore once more
raises the wage to its previous rate.’</p>

<p>On a nearer consideration, Lassalle goes on to say,
the effect of the Iron Law is as follows:—</p>

<p>‘From the produce of labour so much is taken and
distributed among the workmen as is required for their
subsistence.</p>

<p>‘The entire surplus of production falls to the
capitalist. It is therefore a result of the Iron Law
that the workman is necessarily excluded from the
benefits of an increasing production, from the increased
productivity of his own labour.’<a id='r3_8'/><a href='#f3_8' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a></p>

<p><span class='pageno' title='105' id='Page_105'></span></p>

<p>Such is Lassalle’s theory of the Iron Law of Wages.
He accepts it as taught by Ricardo and the economists
of the orthodox school in England, France, and Germany.
We believe that his statement of it is substantially
just and accurate; that it fairly reflects the economic
science of his time, and, under the then prevailing
economic conditions, may be described as a valid law.</p>

<p>Lassalle held that the customary standard of living
and the operation of the law generally were subject to
variation. Still it may reasonably be maintained that
he has not sufficiently considered the fact that, like
capital, the Iron Law of Wages is an historical category.
He has not overlooked the fact, and could hardly do so,
as the Iron Law is an implicate and result of the
domination of capital. But his method of exposition is
too much the controversial one, of pressing it as an
<span class='it'>argumentum ad hominem</span> against his opponents in
Germany, and, as usual, in controversy truth is liable
to suffer. It may therefore be argued that under the
competitive system as now existing, changes have
occurred which render Lassalle’s theory of the Iron Law
inaccurate and untenable. Even while the present
system continues to prevail, the law may undergo very
extensive modification through the progress of education
and organisation among the workmen, and through the
general advance of society in morality and enlightenment.
The question of modification of the Iron Law
is one of degree, and it may fairly be contended by
critics of Lassalle that he has not recognised it to a
sufficient degree.
<span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'></span></p>

<p>On the other hand, it may also be rationally maintained
that in so far as education and organisation prevail
among the workmen, in so far does capitalism, with
all its conditions and implicates, tend to be superseded.
Trade Unions, Co-operative Societies, Factory Legislation,
are all forms of the social control of economic
processes, inconsistent with competitive economics.
The more they gain ground, the more does capitalism
tend to break up and disappear. From this higher point
of view, we may fairly contend that considerations which
have been urged as destructive of Lassalle’s argument
are really symptoms of the decline of capitalism. The
Iron Law is an inevitable result of the historical conditions
contemplated by Lassalle. These conditions
have changed, but the change means that capitalism is
passing away. We are thus thrown back on the wider
question, whether capitalism is disappearing, a question
which it would at present be premature to discuss.</p>

<p>In any case the position of Lassalle is perfectly clear.
He accepted the orthodox political economy in order
to show that the inevitable operation of its laws left
no hope for the working class; and that no remedy
could be found except by abolishing the conditions in
which those laws have their validity—in other words,
by abolishing the present relations of labour and
capital altogether. The great aim of his agitation was
to bring forward a scheme which would strike at the
root of the evil. The remedy for the evil condition of
things connected with the Iron Law of Wages is to
secure the workmen the full produce of their labour, by
<span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'></span>
combining the functions of workmen and capitalists
through the establishment of productive associations.
The distinction between labourer and capitalist is
thereby abolished. The workman becomes producer,
and for remuneration receives the entire produce of
his labour.</p>

<p>The associations founded by Schulze-Delitzsch,
Lassalle went on to argue, would effect no substantial
improvement in the condition of the working class.
The unions for the supply of credit and raw materials
do not benefit the working class as such, but only
the small hand-workers. But hand-labour is an
antiquated form of industry, which is destined to
succumb before the large industry equipped with
machinery and an adequate capital. To provide the
hand-workers with the means of continuing their obsolete
trades is only to prolong the agony of an assured
defeat.</p>

<p>The consumers’ unions, or co-operative stores as we
call them in England, also fail, because they do not
help the workman at the point where he needs it most,
as producers. Before the seller, as before the policeman,
all men are equal; the only thing the seller cares for is
that his customers are able to pay. In discussing the
Iron Law, we saw that the workman must be helped
as producer—that is, in securing a better share of his
product. The consumers’ unions may indeed give a
restricted and temporary relief. So long as the unions
include only a limited number of workmen, they afford
relief by cheapening the means of subsistence, inasmuch
<span class='pageno' title='108' id='Page_108'></span>
as they do not lower the general rate of wages. But in
proportion as the unions embrace the entire working
class and thereby cause a general cheapening of the
means of subsistence, the Iron Law of Wages will take
effect. For the average wage is only the expression in
money of the customary means of subsistence. The
average wage will fall in proportion to the general
cheapening of the means of subsistence, and all the
pains taken by the workmen in founding and conducting
the consumers’ unions will be labour lost. They
will only enable the workman to subsist on a smaller
wage.</p>

<p>The only effectual way to improve the condition of
the working class is through the free individual association
of the workers, by its application and extension
to the great industry. The working class must be its
own capitalist.</p>

<p>But when the workmen on the one hand contemplate
the enormous sums required for railways and factories,
and on the other hand consider the emptiness of their
own pockets, they may naturally ask where they are to
obtain the capital needed for the great industry? The
State alone can furnish it; and the State ought to furnish
it, because it is, and always has been, the duty of
the State to promote and facilitate the great progressive
movements of civilisation. <span class='it'>Productive association with
State credit</span> was the plan of Lassalle.<a id='r4_8'/><a href='#f4_8' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[4]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>The State had already in numerous instances guaranteed
its credit for industrial undertakings by which
<span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span>
the rich classes had benefited—canals, postal services,
banks, agricultural improvements, and especially with
regard to railways. No outcry of socialism or communism
had been raised against this form of State
help? Then why raise it when the greatest problem
of modern civilisation was involved—the improvement
of the lot of the working classes? Lassalle’s estimate
was, that the loan of a hundred million thalers
(£15,000,000) would be more than sufficient to bring
the principle of association into full movement throughout
the kingdom of Prussia.</p>

<p>Obviously the money required for the promotion of
productive associations did not require to be actually
paid by the Government; only the State guarantee for
the loan was necessary. The State would see that
proper rules for the associations should be made and
observed by them. It would reserve to itself the rights
of a creditor or sleeping partner. It would generally
take care that the funds be put to their legitimate use.
But its control would not pass beyond those reasonable
limits: the associations would be free; they would
be the voluntary act of the working men themselves.
Above all, the State, thus supporting and controlling
the associations, would be a democratic State, elected
by universal suffrage, the organ of the workers, who
form an overwhelming majority of every community.</p>

<p>But if we are to conceive the matter in the crudest
way and consider the money as actually paid, wherein
would the enormity of such a transaction consist?
The State had spent hundreds of millions in war, to
<span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'></span>
appease the wounded vanity of royal mistresses, to satisfy
the lust of conquest of princes, to open up markets
for the middle classes; yet when the deliverance of
humanity is concerned the money cannot be procured!</p>

<p>Further, as he takes care to explain, Lassalle did not
propose his scheme of productive associations as the
solution of the social question. The solution of the
social question would demand generations. He proposed
his scheme as the means of transition, as the
easiest and mildest means of transition.<a id='r5_8'/><a href='#f5_8' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[5]</span></sup></a> It was the
germ, the organic principle of an incessant development.
Lassalle has indicated, though only in vague
outline, how such an organic development of productive
associations should proceed. They would begin in
populous centres, in cases where the nature of the industry,
and the voluntary inclination of the workmen to
association, would facilitate their formation. Industries,
which are mutually dependent and work into each
other’s hands, would be united by a credit union; and
there would further be an insurance union, embracing
the different associations, which would reduce their
losses to a minimum. The risks would be greatly
lessened as a speculative industry constantly tending
to anarchy, and all the evils of competition would be
superseded by an organised industry; over-production
would give place to production in advance. In this
way the associations would grow until they embraced
the entire industry of the country. And the general
application of the principle would give an enormous
<span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'></span>
advantage in international competition to the country
adopting it, for it would be rational, systematic, and in
every way more effective and economical.</p>

<p>The goal of the whole development, as conceived by
Lassalle, was a <span class='it'>collectivism</span> of the same type as that
contemplated by Marx and Rodbertus. ‘Division of
labour,’ he says, ‘is really common labour, social
combination for production. This, the real nature
of production, needs only to be explicitly recognised.
In the total production, therefore, it is merely requisite
to abolish individual portions of capital, and to conduct
the labour of society, which is already common, with the
common capital of society, and to distribute the result
of production among all who have contributed to it, in
proportion to their performance.’<a id='r6_8'/><a href='#f6_8' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[6]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>In the controversial work against Schulze-Delitzsch,
Lassalle has at greater length expounded his general
position in opposition to the individualist theories of
his opponents. He contends that progress has not proceeded
from the individual; it has always proceeded
from the community. In this connection he sums up
briefly the history of social development.</p>

<p>The entire ancient world, and also the whole mediæval
period down to the French Revolution of 1789, sought
human solidarity and community in bondage or subjection.</p>

<p>The French Revolution of 1789, and the historical
period controlled by it, rightly incensed at this subjection,
sought freedom in the dissolution of all solidarity
<span class='pageno' title='112' id='Page_112'></span>
and community. Thereby, however, it gained, not
freedom, but license. Because freedom without community
is license.</p>

<p>The new, the present period, seeks solidarity in
freedom.<a id='r7_8'/><a href='#f7_8' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[7]</span></sup></a> He then proceeds in his <span class='it'>theory of conjunctures</span>
to prove that, instead of each man being economically
responsible for what he has done, each man is really
responsible for what he has not done. The economic
fate of the individual is determined by circumstances
over which he has no control, or very little. What does
Lassalle mean by a <span class='it'>conjuncture</span>? We can best understand
it by reference to a great economic crisis which
has occurred since his time. No better example of a
<span class='it'>conjuncture</span> can be found than in the recent history of
British agriculture. In 1876, agriculture, still the most
important industry of the country, began to be seriously
threatened by American competition. The crisis caused
by the low prices due to this competition was greatly
aggravated by bad seasons, such as that of 1879. The
farmers, obliged to pay rent out of capital, were many of
them ruined. In consequence of the diminished application
of capital to land the opportunities of labour
were greatly lessened. Rents could no longer be paid
as formerly. All three classes directly concerned in
English agriculture suffered fearfully, without any
special individual responsibility in the matter. In
Ireland, where the difficulty, great in itself, was intensified
by the national idea, an economic crisis grew into
a great political and imperial crisis. In the eyes of the
<span class='pageno' title='113' id='Page_113'></span>
impartial inquirer, who of all the millions of sufferers
was personally responsible?</p>

<p>Such wide-spread disasters are common in recent
economic history. They are a necessary result of a competitive
system of industry. Lassalle is justly angry with
the one-sided and ill-instructed economists that would
hold the individual responsible for his fate in such a crisis.
Statesmen little understand their duty who would leave
their subjects without help in these times of distress.
And it must always be a praiseworthy feature of
socialism that it seeks to establish social control of these
<span class='it'>conjunctures</span> as far as possible, and to minimise their
disastrous effects by giving social support to those
menaced by them.</p>

<p>The main burden of the <span class='it'>Bastiat-Schulze</span> is Lassalle’s
account of capital and labour.</p>

<p>For Lassalle <span class='it'>capital is a historic category</span>, a product
of historical circumstances, the rise of which we can
trace, the disappearance of which, under altered circumstances,
we can foresee.</p>

<p>In other words, capital is the name for a system of
economic, social, and legal conditions, which are the
result severally and collectively of a long and gradual
process of historical development. The <span class='it'>Bastiat-Schulze</span>
is an elucidation of these conditions. The following
may be taken as a general statement of them:—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>(1) The division of labour in connection with
the large industry.</p>

<p>(2) A system of production for exchange in the
great world-markets.</p>

<p><span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'></span></p>

<p>(3) Free competition.</p>

<p>(4) The instruments of labour, the property of
a special class, who after paying</p>

<p>(5) A class of free labourers in accordance with
the Iron Law of Wages, pocket the surplus value.
Property consists not in the fruit of one’s own
labour, but in the appropriation of that of others.
<span class='it'>Eigenthum ist Fremdthum geworden.</span><a id='r8_8'/><a href='#f8_8' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[8]</span></sup></a></p>

</div>

<p>In this way capital has become an independent,
active, and self-generating power which oppresses its
producer. Money makes money. The labour of the past,
appropriated and capitalised, crushes the labour of the
present. ‘The dead captures the living.’ ‘The instrument
of labour, which has become independent, and has
exchanged <span class='it'>rôles</span> with the workmen, which has degraded
the living workmen to a dead instrument of labour, and
has developed itself, the dead instrument of labour, into
the living organ of production—that is capital.’<a id='r9_8'/><a href='#f9_8' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[9]</span></sup></a> In
such highly metaphorical language does Lassalle sum up
his history of capital. We have already commented on
that aspect of it, the Iron Law of Wages, which Lassalle
has most emphasised. The whole subject is much more
comprehensively treated in the <span class='it'>Kapital</span> of Karl Marx;
therefore we need not dwell upon it further at present.</p>

<p>It will not be wrong, however, to say a word here
about the use of the word capital, as current in the
school of socialists to which Lassalle and Marx belong.
It is not applied by them in its purely economic sense,
as wealth utilised for further production: it is used as
<span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'></span>
the name of the social and economic system in which
the owners of capital are the dominant power. With
them it is the economic factor as operating under the
existing legal and social conditions, with all these conditions
clinging to it. It would be much better to
restrict the word to its proper economic use, and employ
the new word capitalism as a fairly accurate name for
the existing system.</p>

<p>The function of capital under all social systems and
at all historical epochs is fundamentally the same; it is
simply wealth used for the production of more wealth.
But the historical, legal, and political conditions under
which it is utilised vary indefinitely, as do also the
technical forms in which it is embodied.</p>

<p>No real excuse can be offered for the ignorance or
confusion of language of controversialists who maintain
that the object of socialism is to abolish capital. So far
from abolishing capital, socialists wish to make it still
more effective for social well-being by placing it under
social control. What they wish to abolish is the existing
system, in which capital is under the control of a
class. It would be a considerable gain in clearness if
this system were always called capitalism.</p>

<p>We have already remarked upon Lassalle’s theory of
the State, and his treatment of the Iron Law of Wages.
Our further criticism of his social-economic position can
best be brought out by reference to his controversy with
Schulze-Delitzsch, the economic representative of German
Liberalism.</p>

<p>In general it may be said that Lassalle meets the
<span class='pageno' title='116' id='Page_116'></span>
one-sided individualism of Schulze by a statement of
the socialistic, theory, which is also one-sided and exaggerated.
His view of the influence of the community
as compared with that of the individual is the most
prominent example of this. The only accurate social
philosophy is one which gives due attention to both
factors; both are of supreme importance, and either
may fitly be the starting-point of investigation and
discussion.</p>

<p>His theory of conjunctures is overstated. It is to a
considerable degree well founded; in the great economic
storms which sweep over the civilised world the fate
of the individual is largely determined by conditions
over which he has no control. Yet now as ever the
homely virtues of industry, energy, sobriety, and prudence
do materially determine the individual career.</p>

<p>For our present purpose, however, it is more important
to consider Lassalle’s polemic against the practical proposals
of his opponent. Lassalle contended that the
unions for providing credit and raw material would
benefit the hand-workers only, whereas hand-labour is
destined to disappear before the large industry. But,
we may ask, why should not such methods of mutual
help be utilised for associations of working men even
more than for isolated workers? These unions may
be regarded as affording only a very partial and
limited relief to the workmen, but why should the
principle of association among workmen stop there?</p>

<p>The system of voluntary co-operation must begin
somewhere; it began most naturally and reasonably
<span class='pageno' title='117' id='Page_117'></span>
with such unions, and it proceeds most naturally and
reasonably along the line of least resistance to further
development. In these unions the workmen have
been acquiring the capital and experience necessary
for further progress. No limit can be assigned to the
possible evolution of the system. They are properly
to be regarded as only the first beginnings of social
control over the economic processes, the goal and consummation
of which we find in socialism. If in the
controversial struggle Lassalle had listened to the
clear voice of science, he would have seen that, for his
opponent as well as for himself, he must maintain that
all social institutions are subject to and capable of
development.</p>

<p>For the methods of Schulze it may be claimed that
they do not provide a ready-made solution of the social
question, but they are a beginning. For the associations
of Schulze, not less than for those of Lassalle, we may
contend that they supply the organic principle of an
incessant development. In this way the workmen may
attain to the complete management of their own industrial
interests with their own joint capital. They may
thus obtain for themselves the full product of their
labour, in which case the objection of Lassalle, with
regard to the increase of population, under the influence
of the cheap provisions supplied by the stores, would no
more apply to the scheme of Schulze than they would
to his own. In both cases we are to suppose that the
means of subsistence would be more abundant and more
easily obtained; in both cases there might be the risk
<span class='pageno' title='118' id='Page_118'></span>
of a too rapidly increasing population. We may suppose
that this increase of population would be met by a still
greater increase in the product of labour, all going to the
workers. But for the schemes of Schulze there would
be this great advantage that, the capital and experience
of the workers having been acquired by their own exertions,
they would have all the superior training requisite
for the solution of the population question, and all other
questions, which can be obtained only from a long course
of social discipline.</p>

<p>Lassalle would have done well to remember his own
statement, that the only real point of difference between
them was, that one believed in State help, and the
other in ‘self help.’ And we may further ask, Do the
two exclude each other?</p>

<p>In fact, the controversy, considered purely on its
merits, was barren enough. Yet it led to profitable
results, inasmuch as it directed the mind of Germany
to the questions involved, and led to a more thorough
discussion of them.</p>

<p>Better, however, than any argument which can be
urged is the verdict of history on the merits of the
question, as already pronounced during the period which
has elapsed since the date of the controversy. In 1885,
just twenty-one years after the bitter controversy
between the two representatives of State help and self
help, the societies established by Schulze in Germany
alone possessed one hundred million thalers of capital
of their own. It will be remembered that this is the
amount of the loan required by Lassalle from the State
<span class='pageno' title='119' id='Page_119'></span>
to bring his productive associations into operation.
If the workmen fail in productive association, it
will not be, as Lassalle maintained, for want of capital.
Productive association with State credit is therefore
not the only way out of the wilderness.</p>

<p>Must we go further and say that Lassalle’s method
of State help was not the right method at all? It is
certain that the Government of Germany, though
organised on the principle of universal suffrage, has <span class='it'>not</span>
granted the credit demanded by Lassalle, and that his
agitation in this matter has failed owing, it might be
alleged, to his early death, and to the fact that since his
time German socialism has prematurely moved on international,
and even anti-national, lines, thus alienating
from itself the sympathies of the Emperor and his
Chancellor. We need not say how very improbable it
is that the German Government would have guaranteed
its credit, however submissive and conciliatory the
attitude of the Social Democrats might have been. The
Social Democrats themselves, though they gave a place
to Lassalle’s scheme on the Gotha programme of 1875,
seem now disposed to attach little or no importance to
it. It does not appear in the Erfurt programme of the
party, which was adopted in 1891. In short, Lassalle’s
agitation has in the point immediately in question been
a failure. At the same time, it would be absolutely
incorrect to assert that experience has pronounced
against his scheme, inasmuch as no Government has
ever seriously taken it in hand.</p>

<p>Like many other pioneers, Lassalle has not accomplished
<span class='pageno' title='120' id='Page_120'></span>
what he intended, yet he has achieved great
results. We cannot quite accept the dictum of Schiller,
that the world’s history is the world’s judgment. We
are not prepared to believe that all things that have
succeeded were good, and all things that have failed
were evil; or that things are good or evil only in so far
as they succeed or fail. Still, we may well sum up the
controversy between Lassalle and Schulze by stating
that in 1885 the societies founded by the latter had in
Germany a membership of 1,500,000 with a capital of
£15,000,000, and at the election of 1890 the Social
Democracy of Germany, originated by Lassalle, polled
1,427,000 votes. Both have done great things, which
are destined to be greater still. In this, as in so many
other instances, the course of history has not respected
the narrow limits prescribed to it by controversialists.</p>

<p>We need not, however, insist further on the details
of Lassalle’s controversy with Schulze-Delitzsch. Much
more important is it to recall the leading aspects of his
teaching. What Lassalle contemplated and contended
for was a democracy in which the claims of Might and
Right should be reconciled, a democracy of working
men, guided by science, and through universal suffrage
constituting a State which would rise to the high level
of its function as representative and promoter of freedom,
culture, morality, and progress in the fullest and
deepest significance of those great ideas. Above all,
this democracy was to be a social democracy, in which
the political idea should be subordinate to the social;
hence the duty of the State at least to initiate the solution
<span class='pageno' title='121' id='Page_121'></span>
of the social question by granting credit for productive
associations. But this was only to be a beginning;
the solution of the social question must be ardently
worked out for generations until labour should be
entirely emancipated.</p>

<p>With such an ideal, contrast the Prussian-German
State as it actually is. The German State must
still find its basis in the army and police, the most
intelligent of the working class being in profound
discontent. It is a fact worth considering by our
economists and politicians, that the <span class='it'>élite</span> of the working
men of probably the best educated and most thoughtful
nation in the world have gone over to the Social
Democratic party. Nor can the German or any other
State devote itself heartily to the solution of the social
question, for Europe is like a vast camp, in which
science and finance are strained to the uttermost in
order to devise and provide instruments for the destruction
of our fellow-men. Of this state of things the
young Emperor who ascended the throne in 1888 is
only the too willing representative; but even if he
were inclined, he would be powerless to prevent it, as
its causes are too deeply rooted in human nature and
in the present stage of social development to be removed
by anything less than a profound change in the
motives and conditions of life. The historical antecedents
and geographical position of Germany are such
that it must long continue to be a military State;
and most other nations have hindrances of their own.
Reformers must therefore wait long and strive earnestly
<span class='pageno' title='122' id='Page_122'></span>
before they can hope to see such an ideal as that of
Lassalle realised. That the ideal was a noble one, and
that the gratitude of all lovers of progress is due
to him for his energetic and eloquent advocacy of
it, notwithstanding certain unworthy passages in his
career, few will deny.

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br/><br/><span class='it'>RODBERTUS</span></h2>

<p>To those who identify socialism with the extreme
revolutionary spirit, Rodbertus is naturally an enigma.
Everything characteristic of Rodbertus is an express
contradiction of their notion of a socialist. He was a
Prussian lawyer and landowner, a quiet and cultured
student, who disliked revolution and even agitation.
It was a marked feature of his teaching also, that
he meant the socialist development to proceed on
national lines and under national control. Yet it is
impossible to give any reasonable account of socialism
that will exclude Rodbertus. Clearly the only right
way out of the dilemma for those who are caught in it
is to widen their conception of the subject; and
Rodbertus will become perfectly clear and intelligible.</p>

<p>Karl Johann Rodbertus, by some considered to be
the founder of scientific socialism, was born at Greifswald
on 12th August 1805, his father being a professor
at the university there. He studied law at Göttingen
and Berlin, thereafter engaging in various legal occupations;
and, after travelling for some time, he bought
the estate of Jagetzow, in Pomerania, whence his name
<span class='pageno' title='124' id='Page_124'></span>
of Rodbertus-Jagetzow. In 1836 he settled on this
estate, and henceforward devoted his life chiefly to
economic and other learned studies, taking also some
interest in local and provincial affairs.</p>

<p>After the revolution of March 1848 Rodbertus was
elected member of the Prussian National Assembly, in
which body he belonged to the Left Centre; and for
fourteen days he filled the post of Minister of Public
Worship and Education. He sat for Berlin in the
Second Chamber of 1849, and moved the adoption of
the Frankfort imperial constitution, which was carried.
Then came the failure of the revolutionary movement
in Prussia, as elsewhere in Europe, and Rodbertus
retired into private life. When the system of dividing
the Prussian electorate into three classes was adopted,
Rodbertus recommended abstention from voting. His
only subsequent appearance in public life was his
candidature for the first North German Diet, in which
he was defeated.</p>

<p>His correspondence with Lassalle was an interesting
feature of his life. At one time Rodbertus had some
intention of forming a social party with the help of
the conservative socialist Rudolf Meyer and of Hasenclever,
a prominent follower of Lassalle; but no
progress was made in this. Rodbertus was neither
disposed nor qualified to be an agitator, being a man
of a calm and critical temperament, who believed that
society could not be improved by violent changes, but
by a long and gradual course of development. He
warned the working men of Germany against connecting
<span class='pageno' title='125' id='Page_125'></span>
themselves with any political party, enjoining them
to be a social party pure and simple. He died on
8th December 1875.</p>

<p>The general position of Rodbertus was ‘social, monarchical,
and national.’ With his entire soul he held
the purely economic part of the creed of the German
Social Democratic party, yet he did not agree with their
methods, and had no liking for the productive associations
with State help of Lassalle. He regarded a
socialistic republic as a possible thing, but he cordially
accepted the monarchic institution in his own country,
and hoped that a German emperor might undertake the
<span class='it'>rôle</span> of a social emperor. He was also a true patriot,
and was proud and hopeful of the career that lay before
the regenerated empire of Germany.</p>

<p>The basis of the economic teaching of Rodbertus is
the principle laid down by Adam Smith and Ricardo,
and insisted on by all the later socialists, that labour is
the source and measure of value. In connection with
this he developed the position that rent, profit, and
wages are all parts of a national income produced by
the united organic labour of the workers of the community.
Consequently there can be no talk of the wages
of labour being paid out of capital; wages is only
that part of the national income which is received by
the workmen, of a national income which they have
themselves entirely produced. The wages fund theory
is thus summarily disposed of.</p>

<p>But the most important result of the theory is his
position that the possession of land and capital enables
<span class='pageno' title='126' id='Page_126'></span>
the landholders and capitalists to compel the workmen
to divide the product of their labour with those non-working
classes, and in such a proportion that the
workers only obtain as much as can support them in
life. Thus the Iron Law of Wages is established. Hence
also Rodbertus deduces his theory of commercial crises
and of pauperism, and in the following way: In spite
of the increasing productivity of labour, the workers
obtain in general only sufficient to support their class,
and therefore a smaller relative share of the national
income. But the producers form also the large mass
of consumers, and, with the decline of their relative
share in the national income, must decline the relative
purchasing power of this large class of the people. The
growing production is not met by a correspondingly
growing consumption; expansion is succeeded by contraction
of production, by a scarcity of employment,
and a further decline in purchasing power on the part
of the workers. Thus we have a commercial crisis
bringing with it pauperism as a necessary result. In
the meantime the purchasing power of the non-producing
capitalists and landholders continues relatively
to increase; but, as they have already had enough to
buy all the comforts of life, they spend the more
in the purchase of luxuries, the production of which
increases.</p>

<p>A fundamental part of the teaching of Rodbertus is
his theory of social development. He recognised three
stages in the economic progress of mankind: (1) the
ancient heathen period in which property in human
<span class='pageno' title='127' id='Page_127'></span>
beings was the rule; (2) the period of private property
in land and capital; (3) the period, still remote, of
property as dependent on service or desert. The goal
of the human race is to be one society organised on a
communistic basis; only in that way can the principle
that every man be rewarded according to his work be
realised. In this communistic or socialistic State of
the future, land and capital will be national property,
and the entire national production will be under national
control; and means will be taken so to estimate the
labour of each citizen that he shall be rewarded according
to its precise amount. An immense staff of State
officials will be required for this function. As we have
already said, Rodbertus believed that this stage of
social development is yet far distant; he thought that
five centuries will need to pass away before the ethical
force of the people can be equal to it.</p>

<p>From what we have already said, it will be understood
that by his temperament, culture, and social position
Rodbertus was entirely averse to agitation as a means
of hastening the new era; and in the measures which
he recommends for making the transition towards it he
showed a scrupulous regard for the existing interests
of the capitalists and landholders. He proposed that
those two classes should be left in full possession of
their present share of the national income, but that the
workers should reap the benefit of the increasing production.
To secure them this increment of production
he proposed that the State should fix a normal working
day for the various trades, a normal day’s work, and a
<span class='pageno' title='128' id='Page_128'></span>
legal wage, the amount of which should be revised
periodically, and raised according to the increase of
production, the better workman receiving a better wage.
By measures such as these, carried out by the State in
order to correct the evils of competition, would Rodbertus
seek to make the transition into the socialistic
era.</p>

<p>The economic work of Rodbertus is therefore an
attempt made in a temperate and scientific spirit to
elucidate the evil tendencies inherent in the competitive
system, especially as exemplified in the operation of the
Iron Law of Wages. The remedy he proposes is a State
management of production and distribution, which shall
extend more and more, till we arrive at a complete and
universal socialism—and all based on the principle that,
as labour is the source of value, so to the labourer should
all wealth belong.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary further to dwell on the theories
of Rodbertus. The general outlines of his teaching are
clear enough, and the details could be properly treated
only in a work specially devoted to him. In some
leading features his economic position is the same as
that of Marx and Lassalle. The chief difference lies in
the application of their principles. We have seen that
he expects the Prussian or German State to adopt his
theories, but the interest we can have in the very remote
realisation of them in this way naturally cannot
be very great. It was unreasonable to believe that the
people of Germany would make no use of their newly
acquired political rights to promote their social claims;
<span class='pageno' title='129' id='Page_129'></span>
and it is needless to say that a socialistic evolution
slowly carried out under an army of officials is not a
very inviting prospect.</p>

<p>On the recent political economy of Germany, especially
as represented by Adolf Wagner, Rodbertus has
exercised a great influence. For many he is the founder

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br/><br/><span class='it'>KARL MARX</span></h2>

<p>The greatest and most influential name in the history
of socialism is unquestionably Karl Marx. He and his
like-minded companion Engels are the acknowledged
heads of the ‘scientific and revolutionary’ school of
socialism, which has its representatives in almost every
country of the civilised world, and is generally recognised
as the most serious and formidable form of the
new teaching.</p>

<p>Like Ferdinand Lassalle, Karl Marx was of Jewish
extraction. It is said that from the time of his father,
back to the sixteenth century, his ancestors had been
rabbis.<a id='r1_10'/><a href='#f1_10' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a> Marx was born at Treves in 1818, where his
father belonged to the legal profession. Both parents
were highly cultured and raised above the traditions
and prejudices of their race. In 1824, when Marx was
six years of age, the family passed over from Judaism
to the profession of the Christian faith.</p>

<p>Brought up under very favourable circumstances,
ardent and energetic, and endowed with the highest
<span class='pageno' title='131' id='Page_131'></span>
natural gifts, the young Marx speedily assimilated the
best learning that. Germany could then provide. At
the universities of Bonn and Berlin he studied law to
please his father, but following his own bent he gave
his time much more to history and philosophy. Hegel
was still about the zenith of his influence, and Marx
was a zealous student, and for some time an adherent of
the reigning school. In 1841 Marx finished his studies
and gained the degree of doctor with an essay on the
philosophy of Epicurus. This was destined to close his
connection with the German universities. He had intended
to settle at Bonn as teacher of philosophy, but the
treatment which his friend Bruno Bauer as teacher of
theology in the same university experienced at the
hands of the Prussian minister Eichhorn, deterred him
from following out his purpose.</p>

<p>In truth, Marx’s revolutionary temperament was
little suited to the routine of the German man of learning,
and the political conditions of Prussia gave no scope
for free activity in any department of its national life.
Marx therefore could only enter the ranks of the opposition,
and early in 1842 he joined the staff of the <span class='it'>Rhenish
Gazette</span>, published at Cologne as an organ of the extreme
democracy. He was for a short time editor of the paper.
During his connection with it he carried on an unsparing
warfare against the Prussian reaction, and left it
before its suppression by the Prussian Government,
when it sought by compromise to avoid that fate.</p>

<p>In the same year, 1843, Marx married Jenny von
Westphalen, who belonged to a family of good position
<span class='pageno' title='132' id='Page_132'></span>
in the official circles of the Rhine country. Her brother
was subsequently Prussian minister. It was a most
happy marriage. Through all the trials and privations
of a revolutionary career Marx found in his wife a brave,
steadfast, and sympathetic companion.</p>

<p>Soon after his marriage Marx removed to Paris,
where he applied himself to the study of the questions
to which his life and activity were henceforward to
be entirely devoted. All his life he appears to have
worked with extraordinary intensity. At Paris he
lived in close intercourse with the leading French
socialists; with Proudhon he often spent whole nights
in the discussion of economic problems. His most
intimate associates, however, were the German exiles.
Arnold Ruge and he edited the <span class='it'>Deutsch-Französische
Jahrbücher</span>. He met also the greatest of the German
exiles, Heine, and is said to have had a share in
suggesting to the poet the writing of the celebrated
<span class='it'>Wintermärchen</span>.</p>

<p>Most important of all those meetings in Paris, however,
was that with Friedrich Engels. Friedrich Engels
was the son of a manufacturer at Barmen, where he
was born in 1820. Brought up to his father’s business,
Engels had resided for some time in Manchester.
When he met Marx at Paris in 1844 the two men had
already arrived at a complete community of views, and
for nearly forty years continued to be loyal friends and
comrades-in-arms.</p>

<p>Early in 1845, Marx, at the instance of Prussia, was
expelled from Paris by the Guizot Ministry. Marx
<span class='pageno' title='133' id='Page_133'></span>
settled in Brussels, where he resided three years. He
gave up his Prussian citizenship without again becoming
naturalised in any country. It was in 1845 that
Engels published his important work, <span class='it'>The Condition of
the Working Class in England</span>. In Brussels, in 1847,
Marx published his controversial work on Proudhon’s
<span class='it'>Philosophie de la Misère</span>, entitled <span class='it'>Misère de la Philosophie</span>.
Proudhon, it must be remembered, was at that time the
leading name in European socialism, and Marx had been
on very intimate terms with him. Marx’s criticism of
his friend is nevertheless most merciless. In defense
of the German we can but say that such scathing
methods were not unusual at that time, and that where
the cause of truth and of the proletariat as he understood
it was concerned, he scorned all manner of compromise
and consideration for personal feelings. His
book on Proudhon, in spite of its controversial form, is
interesting as the first general statement of his views.</p>

<p>This book on Proudhon scarcely attracted any attention
whatever. In the same year, 1847, he and his
friend Engels had a notable opportunity for an expression
of their common opinions which excited wide
attention, and which has had a great and still growing
influence in the cause of the working man.</p>

<p>A society of socialists, a kind of forerunner of the
International, had established itself in London, and had
been attracted by the new theories of Marx and the
spirit of strong and uncompromising conviction with
which he advocated them. They entered into relation
with Marx and Engels; the society was reorganised
<span class='pageno' title='134' id='Page_134'></span>
under the name of the Communist League; and a congress
was held, which resulted, in 1847, in the framing
of the <span class='it'>Manifesto of the Communist Party</span>, which was
published in most of the languages of Western Europe,
and is the first proclamation of that revolutionary
socialism armed with all the learning of the nineteenth
century, but expressed with the fire and energy of the
agitator, which in the International and other movements
has so startled the world.</p>

<p>During the revolutionary troubles in 1848 Marx
returned to Germany, and along with his comrades,
Engels, Wolff, etc., he supported the most advanced
democracy in the <span class='it'>New Rhenish Gazette</span>. In 1849 he
settled in London, where he spent his after-life in the
elaboration of his economic views and in the realisation
of his revolutionary programme. In 1859 he published
<span class='it'>Zur Kritik der politischen Oekonomie</span>. This book was
for the most part incorporated in the first volume of
his great work on capital, <span class='it'>Das Kapital</span>, which appeared
in 1867.<a id='r2_10'/><a href='#f2_10' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a> Much of his later life was spent in ill
health, due to the excessive work by which he undermined
a constitution that had originally been exceptionally
healthy and vigorous. He died in London,
March 14, 1883. It was a time of the year which had
been marked by the outbreak of the Commune at Paris,
and is therefore for a twofold reason a notable period in
the history of the proletariat.</p>

<p>Since the death of Marx his great work, <span class='it'>Das Kapital</span>,
<span class='pageno' title='135' id='Page_135'></span>
has been completed by the publication of the second
and third volumes, which have been edited by Engels
from manuscripts left by his friend. But neither of
these two volumes has the historical interest which may
fairly be claimed for the first. In 1877 Engels published
on his own account a work called <span class='it'>Herrn Eugen
Dührings Umwälzung der Wissenschaft</span>,<a id='r3_10'/><a href='#f3_10' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a> a controversial
treatise against Dühring (a teacher of philosophy in
the university of Berlin) which has had considerable
influence on the development of the German Social
Democracy. Engels died in 1895, after loyal and consistent
service in the cause of the proletariat, which
extended over more than fifty years.</p>

<p>The causes which have variously contributed to the
rise of German socialism are sufficiently clear. With
the accession of the romanticist Frederick William IV.
to the throne of Prussia in 1840 German liberalism
received a fresh expansion. At the same time the
Hegelian school began to break up, and the interest
in pure philosophy began to wane. It was a time of
disillusionment, of dissatisfaction with idealism, of transition
to realistic and even to materialistic ways of
thinking. This found strongest expression in the
Hegelian left, to which, after the ideals of the old
religions and philosophies had proved unsubstantial,
there remained as solid residuum the real fact of man
with his positive interests in this life. The devotion
<span class='pageno' title='136' id='Page_136'></span>
and enthusiasm which had previously been fixed on
ideal and spiritual conceptions were concentrated on
humanity. To adherents of the Hegelian left, who had
been delivered from intellectual routine by the most
intrepid spirit of criticism, and who therefore had little
respect for the conventionalisms of a feudal society, it
naturally appeared that the interests of humanity had
been cruelly sacrificed in favour of class privilege and
prejudice.</p>

<p>The greatest thinkers of Germany had recognised
the noble elements in the French Revolution. To recognise
also the noble and promising features of French
socialism was a natural thing, especially for Germans
who had been in Paris, the great hearth of the new
ideas. Here they found themselves definitely and consciously
in presence of the last and greatest interest of
humanity, the suffering and struggling proletariat of
Western Europe, which had so recently made its definite
entry in the history of the world. Thus socialism
became a social, political, and economic creed to Karl
Marx and his associates. But they felt that the theories
which preceded them were wanting in scientific basis;
and it was henceforward the twofold aim of the school
to give scientific form to socialism, and to propagate
it in Europe by the best and most effective revolutionary
methods.</p>

<p>The fundamental principle of the Marx school and of
the whole cognate socialism is the theory of ‘surplus
value’—the doctrine, namely, that, after the labourer
has been paid the wage necessary for the subsistence
<span class='pageno' title='137' id='Page_137'></span>
of himself and family, the surplus produce of his labour
is appropriated by the capitalist who exploits it. This
theory is an application of the principle that labour
is the source of value, which was enunciated by many
of the old writers on economics, such as Locke and
Petty, which was set forth with some vagueness and
inconsistency by Adam Smith, and was more systematically
expounded by Ricardo. The socialistic application
of the principle in the doctrine of surplus value
had been made both by Owenites and Chartists. It
was to prevent this appropriation of surplus value by
capitalists and middlemen that the Owen school tried
the system of exchange by labour notes in 1832, the
value of goods being estimated in labour time, represented
by labour notes.</p>

<p>The principle that labour is the source of value has
been accepted in all its logical consequences by Marx,
and by him elaborated with extraordinary dialectical
skill and historical learning into the most complete presentation
of socialism that has ever been offered to the
world. A like application of the principle, but in a less
comprehensive fashion, has been made by Rodbertus;
and it is the same theory that underlies the extravagances
and paradoxes of Proudhon. The question
whether the priority in the scientific development of
the principle is due to Marx or Rodbertus cannot
be discussed here. But it may be said that, the
theory had been set forth by Rodbertus in his first
work in 1842, that the importance of the principle was
understood by the Marx school as early as 1845, and
<span class='pageno' title='138' id='Page_138'></span>
that in a broad and general way it had indeed become
the common property of socialists. The historical importance
and scientific worth of the writings of Rodbertus
should not be overlooked; nor are they likely to
be when so much attention has been given to him by
A. Wagner and other distinguished German economists.</p>

<p>But in the great work of Marx the socialist theory
is elaborated with a fulness of learning and a logical
power to which Rodbertus has no claim. With Marx
the doctrine of surplus value receives its widest application
and development: it supplies the key to his
explanation of the history and influence of capital, and
consequently of the present economic era, which is
dominated by it. It is the basis, in fact, of a vast and
elaborate system of social philosophy. In any case it
is an absurdity as well as an historical error to
speak of Marx as having borrowed from Rodbertus.
Marx was an independent thinker of great originality
and force of character, who had made the economic
development of modern Europe the study of a laborious
lifetime, and who was in the habit, not of borrowing,
but of strongly asserting the results of his own research
and of impressing them upon other men.</p>

<p>The great work of Marx may be described as an
exposition and criticism of capital. But it is also indirectly
an exposition of socialism, inasmuch as the
historical evolution of capital is governed by natural
laws, the inevitable tendency of which is towards
socialism. It is the great aim of Marx to reveal the
law of the economic movement of modern times. Now,
<span class='pageno' title='139' id='Page_139'></span>
the economic movement of modern times is dominated
by capital. Explain, therefore, the natural history of
capital, the rise, consolidation, and decline of its supremacy
as an evolutionary process, and you forecast the
nature of that into which it is being transformed—socialism.
Hence the great task of the Marx school is
not to preach a new economic and social gospel, not to
provide ready-made schemes of social regeneration after
the fashion of the early socialists, nor to counteract by
alleviating measures the wretchedness of our present
system, but to explain and promote the inevitable process
of social evolution, so that the domination of capital
may run its course and give place to the higher system
that is to come.</p>

<p>The characteristic feature of the <span class='it'>régime</span> of capital,
or, as Marx usually calls it, the capitalistic method of
production, is, that industrial operations are carried on
by individual capitalists employing free labourers, whose
sole dependence is the wage they receive. Those free
labourers perform the function fulfilled in other states
of society by the slave and the serf. In the development
of the capitalistic system is involved the growth of
the two classes,—the capitalist class, enriching itself on
the profits of industry, which they control in their own
interest, and the class of workers, nominally free, but
without land or capital, divorced, therefore, from the
means of production, and dependent on their wages—the
modern proletariat. The great aim of the capitalist
is the increase of wealth through the accumulation
of his profits. This accumulation is secured by the
<span class='pageno' title='140' id='Page_140'></span>
appropriation of what the socialists call surplus value.
The history of the capitalistic method of production is
the history of the appropriation and accumulation of
surplus value. To understand the capitalistic system
is to understand surplus value. With the analysis of
value, therefore, the great work of Marx begins.</p>

<p>The wealth of the societies in which the capitalistic
method of production prevails appears as an enormous
collection of commodities. A commodity is in the first
place an external object adapted to satisfy human
wants; and this usefulness gives it value in use, makes
it a use value. These use values form the material of
wealth, whatever its social form may be. In modern
societies, where the business of production is carried
on to meet the demands of the market, for exchange,
these use values appear as exchange values. Exchange
value is the proportion in which use values of different
kinds exchange for each other. But the enormous mass
of things that circulate in the world market exchange
for each other in the most different proportion. They
must, however, have a common quality, or they could
not be compared. This common quality cannot be any
of the natural properties of the commodities. In the
business of exchange one thing is as good as another,
provided you have it in sufficient quantity.</p>

<p>Leaving out of consideration, therefore, the physical
qualities that give commodities use value, we find in
them but one common characteristic—that they are all
products of human labour. They are all crystallised
forms of human labour. It is labour applied to natural
<span class='pageno' title='141' id='Page_141'></span>
objects that gives them value. What constitutes value
is the human labour embodied in commodities. And
the relation of exchange is only a phase of this
value, which is therefore to be considered independently
of it. Further, the labour time spent in producing
value is the measure of value, not this or that individual
labour, in which case a lazy or unskilled man
would produce as great a quantity of value as the most
skilful and energetic. We must take as our standard
the average labour force of the community. The labour
time which we take as the measure of value is the time
required to produce a commodity under the normal
social conditions of production with the average degree
of skill and intensity of labour. Thus labour is both
the source and the measure of value.</p>

<p>The conditions necessary to the existence and growth
of capitalism, therefore, are as follows:—A class, who
have a virtual monopoly of the means of production;
another class of labourers, who are free, but destitute
of the means of production; and a system of production
for exchange in a world market. But it may be asked
how these historical conditions were established? How
did the capitalist class originate, and how were the
workers divorced from the instruments of labour, and
how was the world market opened up?</p>

<p>Such a state of things was established only after
a long and gradual process of change, which Marx
copiously illustrates from the history of England, as the
classic land of the fully developed capitalism. In the
Middle Ages the craftsman and peasant were the owners
<span class='pageno' title='142' id='Page_142'></span>
of the small means of production then extant, and they
produced for their own needs and for their feudal
superior; only the superfluity went into the general
market. Such production was necessarily small, limited,
and technically imperfect. Towards the close of the
Middle Ages a great change set in, caused by a remarkable
combination of circumstances—the downfall of the
feudal system and of the Catholic Church, the discovery
of America and of the sea route to India. Through
the breaking-up of the feudal houses with their numerous
retainers, through the transformation of the old
peasant-holdings into extensive sheep-runs, and generally
through the prevalent application of the commercial
system to the management of land, instead of the
Catholic and feudal spirit, the peasantry were driven
off the land; a multitude of people totally destitute of
property were thrown loose from their old means of
livelihood, and were reduced to vagabondage or forced
into the towns. It was in this way that the modern
proletarians made their tragic entry in history.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there was a parallel development
of the capitalist class, brought about by the slave-trade,
by the exploitation of the American colonies and of both
the Indies, and by the robbery, violence, and corruption
which attended the transference of the land from the
Catholic and feudal to the modern <span class='it'>régime</span>. The opening
and extension of the vast world market, moreover,
gave a great stimulus to industry at home. The old
guilds having already been expropriated and dissolved,
the early organisation of industry under the control of
<span class='pageno' title='143' id='Page_143'></span>
an infant capitalism passed through its first painful and
laborious stages, till, with the great mechanical inventions,
with the application of steam as the motive-power,
and the rise of the factory system towards the
close of the eighteenth century, the great industrial
revolution was accomplished, and the capitalistic method
of production attained to its colossal manhood.</p>

<p>Thus the capitalistic system was established. And
we must remember that in all its forms and through
all the stages of its history the great aim of the capitalist
is to increase and consolidate his gains through the
appropriation of surplus value. We have now to inquire
how this surplus value is obtained?</p>

<p>The starting-point of the capitalistic system is the
circulation of wares. As we have seen, the capitalistic
method of production is dominated by exchange. If
exchange, however, consisted merely in the giving and
receiving of equivalents, there could be no acquisition
of surplus value. In the process of exchange there
must appear something the utilisation of which by the
buyer yields a greater value than the price he pays
for it.</p>

<p>The thing desired is found in the labour force of the
workman, who, being destitute of the means of production,
must have recourse to the owner of these, the
capitalist. In other words, the workman appears on
the market with the sole commodity of which he has
to dispose, and sells it for a specified time at the price
it can bring, which we call his wage, and which is equivalent
to the average means of subsistence required to
<span class='pageno' title='144' id='Page_144'></span>
support himself and to provide for the future supply of
labour (in his family). But the labour force of the
workman, as utilised by the capitalist in the factory or
the mine, produces a net value in excess of his wage;
that is, over and above his entire outlay, including the
wage paid to his workmen, the capitalist finds himself
in possession of a surplus, which can only represent the
unpaid labour of his workmen. This surplus is the
surplus value of Karl Marx, the product of unpaid
labour.</p>

<p>This appropriation of surplus labour is a very old
phenomenon in human society. In all the forms of
society which depended on slave-labour, and under the
feudal <span class='it'>régime</span>, the appropriation of the results of other
men’s labour was open, undisguised, and compulsory.
Under the capitalistic system it is disguised under the
form of free contract. The effect is the same. For the
workman who is unprovided with the instruments of
labour, whose working power is useless without them,
this compulsion is not less real because it is concealed
under the forms of freedom. He must agree to this
free contract or starve.</p>

<p>It is the surplus value thus obtained which the
capitalist seeks to accumulate by all the methods available.
These methods are described by Marx with
great detail and elaboration through several hundred
pages of his first volume. His account, supported at
every step by long and copious citations from the best
historical authorities and from the blue-books of the
various parliamentary commissions, is a lurid and ghastly
<span class='pageno' title='145' id='Page_145'></span>
picture of the many abuses of English industrialism.
It is the dark and gloomy reverse of the industrial
glories of England. The fearful prolongation of the
hours of labour, the merciless exploitation of women
and of children from the age of infancy, the utter
neglect of sanitary conditions—whatever could lessen the
costs of production and swell the profits of the capitalist,
though every law of man and nature were violated in
the process; such are the historical facts which Marx
emphasises and illustrates with an overwhelming force
of evidence. They receive ample confirmation in the
history of the English Factory Acts, imposed on greedy
and unscrupulous capitalists after a severe struggle prolonged
for half a century, and required to prevent the
moral and physical ruin of the industrial population.</p>

<p>We must now consider the process of the development
of capitalism rather more closely.<a id='r4_10'/><a href='#f4_10' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[4]</span></sup></a> Under the
old system industry was carried on by the individual.
There could be no doubt as to the ownership of the
product, as he produced it by his own labour, with
materials and tools that belonged to himself. Such
was the normal method of production in those days.</p>

<p>It is very different in the existing system. The most
conspicuous result of the capitalistic system is, that
production is a social operation carried on by men
organised and associated in factories; but the product
is appropriated by individual capitalists: it is social
production and capitalistic appropriation. Whereas
the property of the preceding era rested on the individual’s
<span class='pageno' title='146' id='Page_146'></span>
own labour, property under the capitalistic
system is the product of other men’s labour. This
is the contradiction which runs through the entire
history of capitalism. Here we have in germ all the
antagonism and confusion of the present time. The
incompatibility of social production and capitalistic appropriation
must more and more declare itself as the
supremacy of the system extends over the world.</p>

<p>The contradiction between social production and
capitalistic appropriation naturally appears in the contrast
between the human beings concerned in it. For
the appropriators form the <span class='it'>bourgeoisie</span>, and the social
workers constitute the proletariat, the two historic
classes of the new era. Another conspicuous and important
result is that, while we have this organisation
in the factory, we have outside of it all the anarchy of
competition. We have the capitalistic appropriators of
the product of labour contending for the possession of
the market, without systematic regard to the supply
required by that market—each one filling the market
only as dictated by his own interest, and trying to outdo
his rivals by all the methods of adulteration, bribery,
and intrigue; an economic war hurtful to the best
interests of society. With the development of the
capitalistic system machinery is more and more perfected,
for to neglect improvement is to succumb in the
struggle; the improved machinery renders labour superfluous,
which is accordingly thrown idle and exposed to
starvation; and this is entirely satisfactory to the
capitalist class, whose interest it is to have a reserve
<span class='pageno' title='147' id='Page_147'></span>
army of labourers disposable for the times when
industry is specially active, but cast out on the streets
through the crash that must necessarily follow.</p>

<p>But as the technique improves the productive power
of industry increases, and continually tends more and
more to surpass the available needs of the market,
wide as it is. This is all the more inevitable, because
the consumption of the masses of the population is reduced
to the minimum requisite merely to maintain
them in life. It is another contradiction of the capitalistic
system that on the one hand its inherent laws tend
to restrict the market which on the other hand it is
ready by all means fair and foul to extend. The consequence
is, that the market tends to be overstocked
even to absolute repletion; goods will not sell, and a
commercial crisis is established, in which we have the
remarkable phenomenon of widespread panic, misery,
and starvation resulting from a superabundance of
wealth—a “crise pléthorique,” as Fourier called it, a
crisis due to a plethora of wealth.</p>

<p>These crises occur at periodic intervals, each one
severer and more widespread than the preceding, until
they now tend to become chronic and permanent, and
the whole capitalistic world staggers under an atlantean
weight of ill-distributed wealth. Thus the process goes
on in obedience to its own inherent laws. Production
is more and more concentrated in the hands of mammoth
capitalists and colossal joint-stock companies, under
which the proletariat are organised and drilled into
vast industrial armies. But as crisis succeeds crisis,
<span class='pageno' title='148' id='Page_148'></span>
until panic, stagnation, and disorder are universal, it
becomes clear that the <span class='it'>bourgeoisie</span> are no longer capable
of controlling the industrial world. In fact, the productive
forces rise in chronic rebellion against the
forms imposed on them by capitalism.</p>

<p>The incompatibility between social production and
anarchic distribution decidedly declares itself. A long
course of hard experience has trained the modern
democracy in the insight necessary for the appreciation
of the conditions of its own existence. The social
character of production is explicitly recognised. The
proletariat seizes the political power, and through it at
last takes complete control over the economic functions
of society. It expropriates the private capitalist, and,
appropriating the means of production, manages them
in its own interest, which is the interest of society as a
whole; society passes into the socialistic stage through
a revolution determined by the natural laws of social
evolution, and not by a merely arbitrary exercise of
power. It is a result determined by the inherent laws
of social evolution, independent of the will and purpose
of individual men. All that the most powerful and
clear-sighted intellect can do is to learn to divine the
laws of the great movement of society, and to shorten
and alleviate the birth-pangs of the new era. The
efforts of reactionaries of every class to turn the wheel
of history backwards are in vain. But an intelligent
appreciation of its tendencies, and a willing co-operation
with them, will make progress easier, smoother, and
more rapid.
<span class='pageno' title='149' id='Page_149'></span></p>

<p>We need hardly return to the <span class='it'>rôle</span> which is played
by surplus value in this vast historical process. The
capitalist appropriates the product of labour because it
contains surplus value. It is the part of the product
that embodies surplus value and represents a clear gain
which attracts him. Surplus value is the beginning,
middle, and end of capitalism. It moves it alike in its
origin and progress, decline and fall. It is the keynote
of a great process of historic evolution continued for
centuries; the secret of a vast development, which
becomes more and more open as time goes on. And
capitalism grows sick of the sustenance which formerly
nourished it. It dies of over-repletion, of habitual
excess in surplus value.</p>

<p>Let us now inquire how far the Marx school have
thrown any light on the forms likely to be assumed by
the new society after the downfall of capitalism. In
his mature works as far as published Marx himself has
said little to guide us. The clearest indication of his
views is contained in the following passage:—‘Let us
assume an association of free men, who work with
common means of production and consciously put forth
their many individual labour powers as a social labour
power. The total product of the association is a social
product. A part of this product serves again as means
of production. It remains social property. But another
part is as means of living consumed by the members of
the association. It must therefore be distributed among
them. The nature of this distribution will change
according to the special nature of the organisation of
<span class='pageno' title='150' id='Page_150'></span>
production and the corresponding grade of historical
development of the producers.’ And then he goes on
to assume that the share of each producer in the means
of living may be determined by his labour time.
Labour time will at once serve as measure of the share
of each producer in the common labour, and therefore
also of his share in the portion of the common product
which is devoted to consumption.<a id='r5_10'/><a href='#f5_10' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[5]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>Another important indication by one who has full
right to speak for Marx is contained in Fr. Engels’
views regarding the State. After the proletariat have
seized political power and transformed the means of
production into State property, the State will cease to
exist. In the old societies the State was an organisation
of the exploiting class for the maintenance of the
conditions of exploitation that suited it. Officially the
representatives of the whole society, the exploiting class
only represented itself. But when the State at last
becomes the real representative of the whole society it
renders itself superfluous. In a society which contains
no subject class, from which class rule and the anarchy
of production and the collisions and excesses of the
struggle for individual existence have been removed,
there is nothing to repress, and no need for a repressing
force like the State. The first act wherein the State
really appears as representative of the entire society—the
appropriation of the means of production in the
name of society—is also its last independent act as
State. In place of the government over persons, there
<span class='pageno' title='151' id='Page_151'></span>
will be an administration of things and the control of
productive processes. The State is not abolished; it
dies away.<a id='r6_10'/><a href='#f6_10' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[6]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>In effect, these two indications of opinion point to a
condition of society which is not fundamentally different
from that contemplated by the anarchist school. Both
look forward to a period when men will live in free
associations, and when the administration of social
affairs will be conducted without the exercise of compulsion.</p>

<p>It will have been seen that what Marx and his school
contemplate is an economic revolution brought about in
accordance with the natural laws of historic evolution.
But in order to understand the full import of this
revolution in the mind of Marx, we must remember
that he regards the economic order of society as the
groundwork of the same, determining all the other
forms of social order. The entire legal and political
structure, as well as philosophy and religion, are constituted
and controlled in accordance with the economic
basis. This is in harmony with his method and his
conception of the world, which is the Hegelian reversed:
‘For Hegel the thought process, which he transforms
into an independent subject under the name idea, is the
creator of the real, which forms only its external manifestation.
With me, on the contrary, the ideal is
nothing else than the material transformed and translated
in the human brain.’ His conception of the world
is a frank and avowed materialism.
<span class='pageno' title='152' id='Page_152'></span></p>

<p>And to a world thus understood he applies the
dialectic method of investigation. Dialectic is a word
current in the Hegelian and other philosophies. It
sounds rather out of place in a materialistic view of the
world. In the system of Marx it means that the business
of inquiry is to trace the connection and concatenation
in the links that make up the process of historic
evolution, to investigate how one stage succeeds another
in the development of society, the facts and forms of
human life and history not being stable and stereotyped
things, but the ever-changing manifestations of the
fluent and unresting real, the course of which it is the
duty of science to reveal. Both Marx and Fr. Engels,
moreover, are fond of expressing the development of
capitalism in the language of the well-known Hegelian
threefold process—thesis, antithesis, and synthesis.
Private property resting on a man’s own labour of the
former times is the thesis. The property resting on
other men’s labour of the capitalistic era is the negation
of this individual property. The expropriation of
the capitalists by the proletariat is the negation of the
negation, or synthesis. But how far this use of the
Hegelian terms is merely a form of literary expression,
or how far it is a survival in Marx of a real belief in
Hegelianism, it is not easy to determine.<a id='r7_10'/><a href='#f7_10' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[7]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>The whole position of the Marx school may be
characterised as evolutionary and revolutionary socialism,
based on a materialistic conception of the world and of
human history. Socialism is a social revolution determined
<span class='pageno' title='153' id='Page_153'></span>
by the laws of historic evolution—a revolution
which, changing the economic groundwork of society,
will change the whole structure.</p>

<p>It may now be convenient to sum up the socialism
of the Marx school under the following heads:—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>(1) Materialistic conception of the world and of
history.</p>

<p>(2) Dialectic method of investigation.</p>

<p>(3) The economic order is the basis of all social
order; the entire legal and political structures of
society, religion, and philosophy are to be explained
in accordance with the economic basis.</p>

<p>(4) The historic evolution of capitalism; how,
from the fifteenth century onwards, the capitalist
class was developed, and how a corresponding
proletariat was created.</p>

<p>(5) The capitalist class grows by the appropriation
and accumulation of the surplus value
contained in the product of labour, whilst the
proletariat is reduced to a subsistence wage. It
is social production and capitalistic appropriation.</p>

<p>(6) Organisation in the factory; anarchy in
society as a whole.</p>

<p>(7) This anarchy is intensified, especially in the
great commercial crises, showing that the middle
class are no longer able to control the productive
forces.</p>

<p>(8) All these contradictions can be solved only
by an explicit recognition of the social character of
<span class='pageno' title='154' id='Page_154'></span>
production. The proletariat seizes political power
and transforms the means of production into social
property.</p>

<p>(9) The State, which has hitherto been an
arrangement for holding the producing class in
subjection, will become superfluous, and die a
natural death. Henceforward, government will
consist simply in the control of industrial processes.</p>

</div>

<p>The work of Marx is a natural history of capital,
especially in its relation to labour, and in its most
essential features is a development of two of the leading
principles of the classic economics—that labour is the
source of value, but that of this value the labourer
obtains for himself merely a subsistence wage, the
surplus being appropriated by the exploiting capitalist.
Marx’s great work may be described as an elaborate
historical development of this glaring fundamental contradiction
of the Ricardian economics, the contradiction
between the Iron Law of Wages and the great principle
that labour is the source of wealth. Marx’s conception
of labour is the same as that of Ricardo, and as a logical
exposition of the historic contradiction between the two
principles, on the basis of Ricardo, the work of Marx is
quite unanswerable. It is obvious, however, that the
definition of labour assumed both in Ricardo and Marx
is too narrow. The labour they broadly posit as the
source of wealth is manual labour. In the early stages
of industry, when the market was small and limited,
and the technique was of the simplest and rudest
<span class='pageno' title='155' id='Page_155'></span>
description, labour in that sense might correctly enough
be described as the source of value. But in modern
industry, when the market is world-wide, the technique
most complex, and the competition most severe, when
inventiveness, sagacity, courage, and decision in initiative,
and skill in management, are factors so important,
no such exclusive place as has been claimed can be
assigned to labour. The Ricardian principle, therefore,
falls to the ground.</p>

<p>And it is not historically true to maintain, as Marx
does, that the profits of the capitalist are obtained simply
by appropriating the products of unpaid labour. In
initiating and managing, the capitalist is charged with
the most difficult and important part of the work of
production. As a natural consequence, it follows that
Marx is also historically inaccurate in roundly explaining
capital as the accumulation of unpaid labour
appropriated by the capitalist. In past accumulation,
as in the control and management of industry generally,
the capitalist has had the leading part. Capital, therefore,
is not necessarily robbery, and in an economic
order in which the system of free exchange is the rule
and the mutually beneficial interchange of utilities, no
objection can be raised to the principle of lending and
borrowing of money for interest. In short, in his
theory of unpaid labour as supplying the key to his
explanation of the genesis and development of the
capitalistic system, Marx is not true to history. It is
the perfectly logical outcome of certain of the leading
principles of the Ricardian school, but it does not
<span class='pageno' title='156' id='Page_156'></span>
give an adequate or accurate account of the facts of
economic evolution.</p>

<p>In his theory of unpaid labour Marx is not consistent
with the general principles of his own philosophy of
social evolution. With him history is a process determined
by material forces, a succession of orderly
phenomena controlled by natural laws. Now we may
waive the objection suggested by the principle enunciated
in the Marx school itself, that it is not legitimate
to apply ethical categories in judgment on economic
processes that are merely natural; which, however,
Marx does with revolutionary emphasis throughout
some hundreds of pages of his great work. It is more
important to point out, in perfect consistency with the
principles of the school, that the energy and inventiveness
of the early capitalists especially were the most
essential factors in determining the existence and
development of a great economic era, and that the
assertion of freedom was an indispensable condition in
breaking the bonds of the old feudal order, which the
new system displaced. Instead, therefore, of living
and growing rich on the produce of unpaid labour, the
capitalist had a great social and industrial function to
perform, and played a great part in historic evolution.
The position and function of the workman was subordinate.</p>

<p>In short, Marx has not sufficiently recognised the
fact that the development of the new social forces
brought with it a new set of functions: that of initiating
and directing industrial enterprise. These functions are
<span class='pageno' title='157' id='Page_157'></span>
not comprehended in the narrow definition of labour,
but they are, nevertheless, most essential to progress;
and the men that performed them have a most complete
historical reason for their existence and a share in the
results of industry. We need not add that such an
argument does not justify all they did as the heads of
the new industry. There is ample evidence that they
were often rough, hard, cruel, and unscrupulous in the
prosecution of their industrial enterprises. Nor does it
prejudice the question whether the like direction of
industry must and should continue in the future.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that in his theory of surplus
value obtained from unpaid labour, Marx, as agitator
and controversialist, has fallen into serious contradiction
with himself as scientific historian and philosopher. The
theory that labour is the source of value was widely
accepted among economists during his early life, and
by its justice and nobleness it was well adapted to the
comfortable optimism prevalent among so many of the
classical school. The economists, however, did not
follow the principle to its obvious conclusion: that if
labour is the source of wealth, the labourer should
enjoy it all. It was otherwise with the socialists, who
were not slow to perceive the bearing of the theory
on the existing economic order. In his controversial
treatise against Proudhon, Marx gives a list of writers
(beginning with the political economy of Hopkins,<a id='r8_10'/><a href='#f8_10' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[8]</span></sup></a>
published in 1822, only five years after the appearance
<span class='pageno' title='158' id='Page_158'></span>
of Ricardo’s great work), by whom the principle was
applied to revolutionary purposes. Its simplicity and
seeming effectiveness must have made it most attractive.
As posited by the classic economy, and applied
by the socialists, Marx accepted the principle. It was an
unanswerable <span class='it'>argumentum ad hominem</span> when addressed
to an economist of the Ricardian school; but it should
have broken down when confronted with historical fact.
Nevertheless it was made, and continued to be, the
foundation-stone of the system of Marx, and is really
its weakest point. His doctrine of surplus value is the
vitiating factor in his history of the capitalistic system.
The most obvious excuse for him is that he borrowed it
from the classic economists.</p>

<p>Fr. Engels sums up the achievement of his friend
Marx in the two great discoveries—the materialistic
conception of history, and the revelation of the secret
of the capitalistic method of production by means of
surplus value. Materialism is a very old theory of the
world. It is now given up by competent thinkers, and
we need not discuss it here. Nor need we say that it
is a grave exaggeration to maintain that all social institutions,
including philosophy and religion, are to be
explained by reference to the economic factors. History
is a record of the activity of the human mind in very
many directions. Men have had various interests, which
have had a substantive, and so far, an independent
value, though they must also be regarded as an organic
whole. It is absolutely impossible to account for all by
reference to any one.
<span class='pageno' title='159' id='Page_159'></span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, it is a great merit of Marx that he has
so powerfully called attention to the vast importance
of the economic side of history. The economic factors
in the life of mankind have been sadly neglected, even
by philosophic historians. Such neglect has been partly
due to the scarcity of material relating to this aspect
of their subject, partly owing to false conceptions of the
function of the historian, chiefly because their public
was a high-bred class, which had no particular wish to
read about such unfashionable topics as those connected
with the daily toil of the lower orders. In this way
the true causation of history has often been overlooked,
or totally misconceived, and results have, in thousands
of instances, been traced to conventional and imaginary
agencies, when the real origin lay deep down in the
economic life of the people. We are now beginning
to see that large sections of history will need to be
rewritten in this new light.</p>

<p>To proceed with our criticism of Marx. It is a
feature of his materialistic conception of history that
his language respecting the inevitable march of society
would sometimes suggest a kind of fatalism. But this
is more than counterbalanced by his strong assertion
of the revolutionary will. On both sides we see overstatement.
The most prominent feature of his teaching,
however, in this reference, is the excessive stress which
he lays on the virtues and possibilities of the revolutionary
method of action. The evolution he contemplates
is attended and disturbed by great historic
breaks, by cataclysm and catastrophe. These and other
<span class='pageno' title='160' id='Page_160'></span>
features of his teaching, to which objection must be
made, were most pronounced in his early writings,
especially in the Manifesto of the Communist League,
but they continue to be visible throughout his life.
According to his latest teaching, a great revolutionary
catastrophe is to close the capitalistic era; and this
must be regarded as a very bad preparation for the
time of social peace which is forthwith to follow. The
proletariat, the class which is to accomplish the revolution,
he described as oppressed, enslaved, and degenerate.
How can such a class be expected to perform so
great an historic function well and successfully?</p>

<p>But the main defect of his teaching lies in the
arbitrariness and excessive abstractness that characterise
his method of investigation and presentation; and
this defect particularly attaches to the second great
discovery attributed to him by Fr. Engels—his theory
of surplus value.</p>

<p>We shall better understand the position of Marx if
we recall some of the important circumstances in his
life and experience. As we have seen, his family passed
from the profession of Judaism to Christianity when
he was six years of age, and he thus lost the traditions
of the faith of his ancestors without living into the
traditions of the new faith. Like many Jews in a
similar position the traditions of the past therefore had
little influence on Karl Marx, and he was so far well
fitted to take a wide and unprejudiced view of human
affairs. With his great endowments and vast knowledge
he should have been one of the freest heads in Europe.
<span class='pageno' title='161' id='Page_161'></span>
His practical energy was not inferior to the range of
his intelligence.</p>

<p>All the more regrettable, therefore, is it that Marx
should have adopted such a narrowing system of philosophy
as materialism. It is also remarkable that he,
the severest of critics, should have adopted, at so early
an age and without due scrutiny, the theory of value
set forth by Adam Smith and Ricardo, and that he
should have applied it without question during the
remainder of his life to the building up of a vast system
of thought, and to a socialistic propaganda which was
meant to revolutionise the world. Another instance of
the premature dogmatism which has so often exercised
a great and not seldom a mischievous influence on
human thought.</p>

<p>In this connection it may not be altogether fanciful
to observe that his heredity derived from rabbinical
ancestors may account for much that is peculiar in his
way of thinking. The excessive acumen, the relentless
minuteness with which he pursues his course through
details which often seem very unreal, the elaboration
which he bestows upon distinctions which are often
abstract and artificial, may well be regarded as alien to
Western modes of thought. Revolutionary materialism
was a strange sphere in which to exercise a logic after
the manner of the rabbi.</p>

<p>However this may be, we know that when his mind
was being formed the Hegelian philosophy was supreme
in Germany; and it can hardly be said that the study
of Hegel is a good training for the study of history,
<span class='pageno' title='162' id='Page_162'></span>
according to the freest and purest conception of the
subject. The study of history, in the highest sense of
the word, requires a modest attitude towards objective
fact which is not easily attained in the philosophy of
the schools.</p>

<p>Marx was a German, trained in the school of Hegel;
and he passed most of his life in laborious seclusion,
in exile and revolt against dominant ideas and institutions.
Though a materialist, he does not show sufficient
respect for facts, for history. In reading his great
work we feel that the facts are in chronic rebellion
against the formulas to which he seeks to adapt them.</p>

<p>Adam Smith, the founder of Political Economy, was
also academic at the outset of his life; but he was a
Scotsman of a period when the ablest Scotsmen were
trained by French clearness and common sense. And
he was not in revolt, like Marx, but in full sympathy
with a cause whose time had come, whereas Marx
represented a cause which had not yet attained to any
considerable degree of clearness. In learning and
philosophic power, Marx will compare favourably with
Adam Smith; but in historic reasonableness, in respect
for fact and reality, Smith is decidedly his superior.
In Smith’s great work we see philosophy controlled by
fact, by historic knowledge and insight. The work of
Marx, in many of its most important sections, is an
arbitrary and artificial attempt to force his formulas
on the facts of history. Whether the fault lay in the
Hegelian philosophy, or in Marx’s use of it, there can
be no doubt that its influence has inflicted most serious
<span class='pageno' title='163' id='Page_163'></span>
damage on what might otherwise have been a splendid
historical work.</p>

<p>We are therefore obliged to say that the historical
work of Marx does not by any means rise to the
highest conception of history. It is deficient in the
free outlook, in the clear perspective, in the sympathy
and impartiality which should characterise the best
historical achievements. The historical work of Marx
is placed at the service of a powerful and passionate
propaganda, and of necessity is disturbed and troubled
by the function which it is made to serve.</p>

<p>In dealing with history we must accept facts and
men as we find them. The facts are as they are; and
the men of history are not ideal men. Like other men
Marx had to work under human limitations. The
great task of his life was to rouse the proletariat of the
world to a sense of its position, its mission, and destiny,
to discover the scientific conditions under which a new
era in the evolution of the human race could be inaugurated
and carried on by the working classes of all
lands. It was a mixed task in which science and
practice were combined, and in which the purely
scientific study of history naturally suffered in the
partnership with a very strenuous revolutionary
practice.</p>

<p>We need not say that it was not the fault of Marx
that he adopted the revolutionary career. He was
born at a time and in a country where men of independence
and originality of character of necessity
became revolutionists. In face of the European reaction
<span class='pageno' title='164' id='Page_164'></span>
Marx never made any concession or compromise.
He never bowed himself in the house of Rimmon.
Seldom in the history of human thought has there
been a man who travelled right ahead in so straightforward
a path, however formidable the opposition and
however apparently hopeless surrounding circumstances
might be. Public opinion had no weight with him;
neither idle sentiment nor amiable weaknesses found
any place in his strongly-marked individuality.</p>

<p>In view of such a career spent in the unflinching
service of what he regarded to be truth, and in the
greatest of human causes, it would be mean and disgraceful
not to speak of Marx in terms of profound
respect. His sincerity, his courage, his self-abnegation,
his devotion to his great work through long years of
privation and obloquy, were heroic. If he had followed
the broad and well-beaten highway of self-interest,
Marx, with his exceptional endowments both for
thought and action, might easily have risen to a
foremost place in the Prussian State. He disdained
the flesh-pots of despotism and obscurantism so much
sought after by the average sensual man, and spent
forty hard and laborious years almost wholly in exile
as the scientific champion of the proletariat. Many
men are glad to live an hour of glorious life. Few
are strong and brave enough to live the life heroic
for forty years with the resolution, the courage, and
consistency of Karl Marx.</p>

<p>In the combination of learning, philosophic acumen,
and literary power, he is second to no economic thinker
<span class='pageno' title='165' id='Page_165'></span>
of the nineteenth century. He seems to have been
master of the whole range of economic literature, and
wielded it with a logical skill not less masterly. But
his great strength lay in his knowledge of the technical
and economic development of modern industry, and in
his marvellous insight into the tendencies in social
evolution determined by the technical and economic
factors. Whether his theories in this department are
right or wrong, they have suggested questions that will
demand the attention of economic thinkers for a long
time to come. It is in this department, and not in his
theory of surplus value, that Marx’s significance as a
scientific economist is to be found.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all that may justly be said in
criticism of Marx, it remains, then, that his main
achievement consists in the work he has done as
scientific inquirer into the economic movement of
modern times, as the philosophic historian of the
capitalistic era. It is now admitted by all inquirers
worthy of the name that history, including economic
history, is a succession of orderly phenomena, that
each phase in the line of succession is marked by facts
and tendencies more or less peculiar to itself, and that
laws and principles which we now condemn had formerly
an historical necessity, justification, and validity.
In accordance with this fundamental principle of historical
evolution, arrangements and institutions which
were once necessary, and originally formed a stage in
human progress, may gradually develop contradictions
and abuses, and thus become more or less antiquated.
<span class='pageno' title='166' id='Page_166'></span></p>

<p>The economic, social, and political forms which were
the progressive and even adequate expressions of the
life of one era, become hindrances and fetters to the
life of the succeeding times. This, the school of Karl
Marx says, is precisely the condition of the present
economic order. The existing arrangements of landlord,
capitalist, and wage-labourer under free competition
are burdened with contradiction and abuse. The
life of society is being strangled by the forms which
once promoted it. They maintain that the really vital
and powerful tendencies of our time are towards a
higher and wider form of social and economic organisation—towards
socialism. Here, as we believe, is the
central point of the whole question. The place of
Marx in history will depend on how far he has made
a permanent contribution towards the settlement
of it.</p>

<p>During his lifetime the opinions of Marx were
destined to find expression in two movements, which
have played a considerable part in recent history—the
International and the Social Democracy of Germany.
Of the International, Marx was the inspiring and controlling
head from the beginning; and the German
Social Democracy, though originated by Lassalle, before
long fell under Marx’s influence. Marx wrote the

drew up its statutes, maintaining a moderation of tone
which contrasted strongly with the outspoken vigour
of the communist manifesto of 1847. But it was not
long before the revolutionary socialism which underlay

no doubt afforded a splendid opportunity for
the propaganda of Marx. The fortunes of the International
and of the German Social Democracy will be
sketched in subsequent chapters.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br/><br/>THE INTERNATIONAL</h2>

<p>It is an inevitable outcome of the prevalent historic
forces that the labour question has become international.</p>

<p>From the dawn of history there has been a widening
circle of communities with international relations.
Civilisation had its earliest seats on the banks of the
Nile and the Euphrates. The Greeks and Phœnicians
carried it round the shores of the Mediterranean. The
Romans received it from the Greeks, and, after adding
to it a valuable contribution of their own, handed it on
to the nations of Western and Central Europe. The
Christian Church spread over the countries in which
the Roman peace prevailed, but did not confine itself
to the limits of the empire.</p>

<p>Amidst the group of nations who thus participated
in the Greco-Roman culture and in the Christian life,
there has always been a special degree of international
sympathy: ideas and institutions have been largely
common to them all. Feudalism and the Church,
chivalry and the Crusades, all these were international
in their influence.
<span class='pageno' title='169' id='Page_169'></span></p>

<p>Then, as now, great ideas and great movements
could not be confined within national barriers. In the
expansive and progressive epochs of history, particularly,
supreme interests have raised men above the
prejudices of race, and have united them by wider
and deeper principles than those by which they are
separated into nations.</p>

<p>At the great religious revolt of the sixteenth
century, Germans combined with the Swedes and the
French against their own countrymen. The Catholic
Church, as its name implies, has always been, and still
continues to be, a great international institution.</p>

<p>The enlightenment of the eighteenth century had an
international influence, and at the French Revolution
high concerns of political and social freedom for a time
broke through the conventional feelings of patriotism.
Germans, Italians, and even Englishmen, were in many
cases ready to receive the boon of a better order of
things at the price of French victory over their own
countrymen. Only for a time, till the enthusiasm of
the Revolution was made subservient to the selfishness
of the new France—an instrument for the colossal
egotism of a single man.</p>

<p>In our time, steam and the electric telegraph have
become the bearers of a widening international movement.
All the great human interests are cultivated
and pursued on a wider scale than ever—religion,
science, literature, art.</p>

<p>Commerce and industry have naturally shared in the
general expansion. We have only to scan the operations
<span class='pageno' title='170' id='Page_170'></span>
of the great markets and exchanges in any daily
paper as a proof of this. In a small space round the
Bank of England, financial transactions are carried on
which powerfully affect the entire world. Even the
very simple breakfast of an ordinary citizen is a great
international function, in which the productions of the
most diverse countries combine to appease his wants.</p>

<p>The methods and appliances of this modern industry
have been developed in England since the middle of the
eighteenth century. Not many years ago England was
still the supreme, almost the exclusive, representative
of the new industry; now it is becoming the common
possession of all countries dominated by European
culture, and is rapidly gaining ground in the long-isolated
nations of the East. The competition for
business among the capitalists of various countries
grows more intense every year. Once carried on chiefly
or entirely for local needs, production has now to work
for a market of wide and often incalculable extent.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, we need not be surprised
that labour, the prime factor in industry, has international
interests and relations of the most serious
importance. Its antagonism to capitalism must declare
itself on the international arena. In the competitive
struggles of the last sixty years, the cheap labour of one
nation has not seldom been thrown into the scale to
weigh down the dear labour of another. Irishmen,
Germans, Belgians, and Italians have often rendered
unavailing the efforts of English and French workmen
for a higher standard of living. Continuous emigration
<span class='pageno' title='171' id='Page_171'></span>
from Europe depresses American labour. The Chinese
and other Eastern races, habituated to a very low
standard of subsistence, menace the workmen of
America and Australia. The great industry which is
now being established in the East will be a most
serious danger alike to workmen and capitalists in
the Western World.</p>

<p>The capitalists of most countries have long sought to
shield themselves against the consequences of competition
by protection, by combinations tacit or avowed
among themselves, of wide and frequently international
magnitude. In view of the facts that we have indicated,
in view of the example thus set them, why should not
the working men seek to regulate their international
interests?</p>

<p>Efforts towards the international organisation of
labour have proceeded chiefly from men who, banished
from their own country by reactionary governments,
have carried to other lands the seeds of new thought,
and, meeting abroad those of like mind and like fate
with themselves, have naturally planned the overthrow
of their common oppressors. The origin of the famous
International Association of Working Men was largely
due to such a group of exiles.</p>

<p>In 1836, a number of German exiles at Paris formed
themselves into a secret society, under the name of the
<span class='it'>League of the Just</span>, the principles of which were communistic.<a id='r1_11'/><a href='#f1_11' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a>
Being involved in a rising at Paris in 1839,
<span class='pageno' title='172' id='Page_172'></span>
they removed to London. Here they met with workmen
belonging to the nations of Northern Europe, to
which German is a common speech, and the League
naturally began to assume an international character.</p>

<p>This was not the only change which the League
underwent. Its members began to understand that
their real duty under the present circumstances was
not conspiracy or the stirring up of revolutionary outbreaks,
but propaganda. The basis of the League had
been a sentimental communism, based on their motto
that ‘all men are brothers.’ From Marx they learned
that the emancipation of the proletariat must be guided
by scientific insight into the conditions of its own
existence and its own history; that their communism
must indeed be a revolutionary one, but it must be a
revolution in harmony with the inevitable tendencies of
social evolution. The cardinal point in the theory
worked out by Marx and now impressed upon the
League, was the doctrine that the economic conditions
control the entire social structure, therefore the main
thing in a social revolution is a change in economic
conditions.</p>

<p>The group of exiles put themselves into communication
with Marx, and a Congress was held in London in
1847, with the result that the association was reorganised
under the name of the Communist League.</p>

<p>The aim of the League is very comprehensively stated
in the first article of its constitution: ‘The aim of the
League is the overthrow of the <span class='it'>bourgeoisie</span>, the rule of
the proletariat, the abolition of the old society resting
<span class='pageno' title='173' id='Page_173'></span>
on class antagonisms, and the founding of a new society
without classes and without private property.’</p>

<p>Marx and Engels were commissioned by the League
to set forth its principles in a manifesto, which, as the
manifesto of the communistic party, was published
shortly before the Revolution of February 1848. We
shall best illustrate the spirit and aim of the treatise
by quoting Fr. Engels’ Preface to the edition of 1883:—</p>

<p>‘The Preface to the present edition I must, alas!
sign alone. Marx, the man to whom the entire working
class of Europe and America owes more than any other—Marx
rests in the cemetery at Highgate, and the
grass already begins to grow over his grave. Since
his death nothing further can be said of a revisal
or completion of the manifesto. It is therefore the
more necessary expressly to make the following statement.</p>

<p>‘The pervading thought of the manifesto: that the
economic production with the social organisation of each
historical epoch necessarily resulting therefrom forms
the basis for the political and intellectual history of this
epoch; that accordingly (since the dissolution of the
primitive common property in land) the entire history
is a history of class struggles—struggles between exploited
and exploiting, ruled and ruling, classes at
different stages of social development; but that this
struggle has now reached a stage when the exploited
and oppressed class (the proletariat) can no more free
itself from the exploiting and oppressing class (the
<span class='it'>bourgeoisie</span>) without at the same time delivering the
<span class='pageno' title='174' id='Page_174'></span>
whole of society for ever from exploitation, oppression,
and class struggles—this pervading thought belongs
exclusively and alone to Marx.’</p>

<p>‘The history of all society hitherto has been the
history of class struggles’; such is the keynote of the
manifesto. ‘But it is a distinguishing feature of the
present time that it has simplified class antagonisms;
the entire human society more and more divides itself
into two great hostile camps, into two great conflicting
classes, <span class='it'>bourgeoisie</span> and proletariat.’ The manifesto is
for the most part an exposition and discussion of these
two classes, the historical conditions under which they
have grown up, their mutual relations, past, present,
and future.</p>

<p>It would not be easy to give a brief analysis of the
manifesto, nor is it necessary, as we have, in our chapter
on Marx, already given an account of the same views in
their maturer and more philosophic expression. The
manifesto is a treatise instinct with the fiery energy and
enthusiasm of a young revolutionary party, and its
doctrines are the doctrines of Marx in a crude, exaggerated,
and violent form. In such a pamphlet, written
for propaganda, we must not expect the self-restraining
moderation of statement, the clear perspective, or the
high judicial charity which should characterise a sober
historical exposition.</p>

<p>The Iron Law of Wages is stated in its hardest and
most exaggerated form. To the charge that they desire
to abolish private property, its authors reply that individual
property, the produce of a man’s own labour, is
<span class='pageno' title='175' id='Page_175'></span>
already abolished. What they desire to abolish is the
appropriation of other men’s labour by the capitalist.
To the charge that they wish to abolish the family, they
reply to the <span class='it'>bourgeoisie</span> with a <span class='it'>tu quoque</span>: ye have
already abolished it by the exploitation of women and
children in the factories, which has broken up the
family ties, through the prevalence of prostitution and
the common practice of adultery. The charge of abolishing
patriotism they repudiate in the same manner: the
workman has no country.</p>

<p>We cannot understand the manifesto unless we remember
that it was drawn up by young men living in
exile, and that it was written in 1847, shortly after
some of the earliest inquiries into the condition of labour
both in England and the Continent had revealed facts
which ought to fill every human heart with sorrow and
indignation.</p>

<p>As the manifesto of the first international combination
of workmen, it has a special historical importance,
and claims special attention. And apart from that, it is
one of the most remarkable utterances of the nineteenth
century.</p>

<p>‘The manifesto,’ says Fr. Engels, ‘was sent to the
press at London a few weeks before the February Revolution.
Since then it has made the tour of the world.
It has been translated into almost every tongue, and in
the most different countries still serves as the guiding-star
of the proletarian movement. The old motto of
the League, “All men are brethren,” was replaced by
the new battle-cry, “Proletarians of all lands unite,”
<span class='pageno' title='176' id='Page_176'></span>
which openly proclaimed the international character of
the struggle. Seventeen years later this battle-cry
resounded through the world as the watchword of
the International Working Men’s Association, and the
militant proletariat of all lands has to-day written it on
its banner.’<a id='r2_11'/><a href='#f2_11' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>The Revolution of 1848, as we have already seen,<a id='r3_11'/><a href='#f3_11' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a>
was a rising of the people in France, Italy, Germany,
Austria, and Hungary against antiquated political
arrangements and institutions. It was partly an interruption
to the operations of the League, as it was far
too weak to exercise any great influence on the course
of events; but it was also an opportunity, as its
members found access to the land of their birth, and in
many parts of Germany formed the most resolute and
advanced wing of the struggling democracy during that
troubled period.</p>

<p>After the triumph of the reaction it became clear
that the hope of effective revolutionary activity had
again for a time passed away. A period of unexampled
industrial prosperity set in. Capitalism was about to
enter a far wider phase of development than it had yet
seen, a fact which abundantly showed that the time was
not favourable for an active propaganda in the interests
of the proletariat. When capitalism has become a
hindrance to progressive social development, when it is
obviously too weak and narrow a framework for further
evolution, only then is there hope of successful effort
against it. So reasoned Marx and his associates. He
<span class='pageno' title='177' id='Page_177'></span>
withdrew, therefore, from the scene of action to his
study in London. In 1852 the first international combination
of working men came to a close. Observers
who could not reasonably be considered superficial,
thought that the movement had died without hope of
resurrection.</p>

<p>But the triumph of reactionary governments in 1849
was not a settlement of the great questions that had
been raised during that period of revolution; it was
only a postponement of them. Before many years had
passed, the peoples of Europe again began to move
uneasily under the yoke of antiquated political forms.
The rising of Italy against Austria in 1859; the struggle
of Prussian Liberals against the Ministry; the resolve
of Bismarck and his Sovereign to have the Prussian
army ready for action in the way of reconstituting a
united Germany on the ruins of the old Federation—these
were only different symptoms of a fresh advance.
They were ere long to be followed by similar activity in
France, Spain, and Eastern Europe, all proving that the
history of European communities is an organic movement,
the reach and potency of which often disturb the
forecast of the politician. In the generation after 1848
the governments were everywhere constrained to carry
out the political programme which the people had
drawn out for them during the revolution.</p>

<p>The social question may seem to have only a remote
connection with the political movements just mentioned,
and yet the revival of the social question was but another
sign of the new life in Europe, which could not be
<span class='pageno' title='178' id='Page_178'></span>
repressed. The founding of the Social Democracy of
Germany by Lassalle, and the appearance of the International
on a wider and worthier scale under the auspices
of Marx, were a clear proof that the working classes of
the most advanced countries of Europe now meant to
claim a better share in the moral and material inheritance
of the human race. We have now to sketch the
growth of the movement, which is properly styled the
International.</p>

<p>Appropriately enough, the event which gave the first
occasion for the founding of the International Association
of Working Men was the International Exhibition
of London in 1862. The workmen of France sent a
deputation to visit the Exhibition. This visit had the
approval and even pecuniary support of the Emperor;
and it was warmly commended by some of the leading
Parisian journals as a means not only of acquainting
the workmen with the industrial treasures of the Exhibition,
but of removing from the relations of the two
countries the old leaven of international discord and
jealousy. In the course of their visit the French delegates
were entertained by some of their English brethren
at the Freemasons’ Tavern, where views as to the identity
of the interests of labour, and the necessity for common
action in promoting them, were interchanged.</p>

<p>In the following year a second deputation of French
workmen crossed the Channel. Napoleon was interested
in the Polish insurrection of 1863, and it was part of
his policy to encourage the expression of opinion in
favour of an intervention in Poland by the Western
<span class='pageno' title='179' id='Page_179'></span>
Powers. At this visit wishes for the restoration of
Poland and for general congresses in the interest of
labour against capital were expressed. Nothing decisive,
however, was done till 1864, when on the 28th September
a great public meeting of working men of all nations
was held in St. Martin’s Hall, London. Professor
Beesly presided, and Karl Marx was present. The
meeting resulted in the appointment of a provisional
committee to draw up the constitution of the new association.
This committee consisted of fifty representatives
of different nations, the English forming about
half of its number. At the first meeting of the committee
the sum of three pounds was collected, a humble
beginning of the finances of an association which was
designed to shake the world.</p>

<p>The work of drafting the constitution was first of all
undertaken by Mazzini, but the ideas and methods of
the Italian patriot were not suited to the task of
founding an international association of labour. The
statutes he drew up were adapted to the political
conspiracy, conducted by a strong central authority,
in which he had spent his life; he was strongly opposed
to the antagonism of classes, and his economic ideas
were vague. Marx, on the other hand, was in entire
sympathy with the most advanced labour movement—had
indeed already done much to mould and direct it;
to him, therefore, the duty of drawing up a constitution
was transferred. The inaugural address and the
statutes drawn up by him were unanimously adopted
by the committee.
<span class='pageno' title='180' id='Page_180'></span></p>

<p>In the inaugural address<a id='r4_11'/><a href='#f4_11' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[4]</span></sup></a> three points were particularly
emphasised. First, Marx contended that, notwithstanding
the enormous development of industry
and of national wealth since 1848, the misery of the
masses had not diminished. Secondly, the successful
struggle for the ten-hours working-day meant the
break-down of the political economy of the middle
classes, the competitive operation of supply and demand
requiring to be regulated by social control. Thirdly,
the productive association of a few daring ‘hands’ had
proved that industry on a great scale, and with all the
appliances of modern science, could be carried on without
the existence of capitalist masters; and that wage-labour,
like slave-labour, was only a transitory form,
destined to disappear before associated labour, which
gives to the workman a diligent hand, a cheerful spirit,
and a joyful heart.</p>

<p>The numbers of the workmen gave them the means
of success, but it could be realised only through union.
It was the task of the International to bring about such
an effective union, and for this end the workmen must
take international politics into their own hands, must
watch the diplomacy of their Governments, and uphold
the simple rules of morality in the relations of private
persons and nations. ‘The struggle for such a policy
forms part of the struggle for the emancipation of the
working class; proletarians of all lands, unite!’</p>

<p>The preamble to the statutes contains implicitly the
<span class='pageno' title='181' id='Page_181'></span>
leading principles of international socialism. The
economic subjection of the workmen to the appropriator
of the instruments of labour—that is, of the sources of
life—is the cause of servitude in all its forms, of social
misery, of mental degradation and political dependence;
the economic emancipation of the working class is
the great aim to which every political movement must
be subordinated; the emancipation of the working
class is neither a local nor a national, but a social
problem, to be solved only by the combined effort of the
most advanced nations.</p>

<p>‘For these reasons the International Association of
Working Men has been founded. It declares:</p>

<p>‘That all societies and individuals who adhere to it
recognise truth, justice, and morality as the rule of their
conduct towards one another, and to all men without
distinction of colour, faith, or nationality. No duties
without rights; no rights without duties.’</p>

<p>Such are the leading ideas of the preamble; we have
only to develop them, and we have the programme of
international socialism. Whatever opinion we may
hold of the truth and practicability of the theories set
forth in it, we must respect the lucid and masterly
form in which Marx has presented them. It is seldom
in the history of the world that talents and learning
so remarkable have been placed at the service of an
agitation that was so wide and far-reaching.</p>

<p>The International Association was founded for the
establishment of a centre of union and of systematic
co-operation between the working-men societies, which
<span class='pageno' title='182' id='Page_182'></span>
follow the same aim—viz. the protection, the progress
and the complete emancipation of the working class. It
would be a mistake to regard its organisation as one of
excessive centralisation and dictatorial authority. It
was to be a means of union, a centre of information
and initiative, in the interests of labour; but the existing
societies which should join it were to retain their
organisation intact.</p>

<p>A General Council, having its seat in London, was
appointed. While the president, treasurer, and general
secretary were to be Englishmen, each nation was to be
represented in the Council by a corresponding secretary.
The General Council was to summon annual congresses
and exercise an effective control over the affairs of the
Association, but local societies were to have free play in
all local questions. As a further means of union, it was
recommended that the workmen of the various countries
should be united in national bodies, represented by
national central organs, but no independent local
society was to be excluded from direct correspondence
with the General Council. It will be seen that the
arrangements of the Association were so made as to
secure the efficiency of the central directing power on
the one hand, and on the other to allow local and
national associations a real freedom and abundant scope
for adapting themselves to the peculiar tasks imposed
on them by their local and national position.</p>

<p>As in founding, so in conducting the International,
Marx took the leading part. The proceedings of the
various congresses might be described as a discussion,
<span class='pageno' title='183' id='Page_183'></span>
elucidation, and filling up of the programme sketched
by him in the inaugural address and in the statutes of
the Association. Men representing the schools of
Proudhon (who died in 1865), of Blanqui, and of Bakunin
also exercised considerable influence; but the general
tendency was in accordance with the views of Marx.</p>

<p>It was intended that the first congress for finally
arranging the constitution of the Association should be
held at Brussels in 1865, but the Belgian Government
forbade the meeting, and the Council had to content
itself with a conference in London. The first congress
was held at Geneva in September 1866, sixty delegates
being present. Here the statutes as drafted by Marx
were adopted. Among other resolutions it decided on
an agitation in favour of the gradual reduction of the
working day to eight hours, and it recommended a most
comprehensive system of education, intellectual and
technical, which would raise the working people above
the level of the higher and middle classes. Socialistic
principles were set forth only in the most general
terms. With regard to labour the International did
not seek to enunciate a doctrinaire system, but only
to proclaim general principles. They must aim at free
co-operation, and for this end the decisive power in the
State must be transferred from capitalists and landlords
to the workers.</p>

<p>The proposal of the French delegates for the exclusion
of the intellectual proletariat from the Association led
to an interesting discussion. Was this proletariat to
be reckoned among the workers? Ambitious talkers
<span class='pageno' title='184' id='Page_184'></span>
and agitators belonging to this class had done much
mischief. On the other hand, their exclusion from
socialistic activity would have deprived the labourers of
the services of most of their greatest leaders, and the
intellectual proletariat suffered from the pressure of
capital quite as much as any other class of workers.
The proposal for their exclusion was rejected.</p>

<p>The second congress, held at Lausanne in 1867, made
considerable progress in the formulating of the socialistic
theories. It was resolved that the means of transport
and communication should become the property of the
State, in order to break the mighty monopoly of the
great companies, under which the subjection of labour
does violence to human worth and personal freedom.
The congress encouraged co-operative associations and
efforts for the raising of wages, but emphatically called
attention to the danger lest the spread of such
associations should be found compatible with the
existing system, thus resulting in the formation of
a fourth class, and of an entirely miserable fifth.
The social transformation can be radically and definitely
accomplished only by working on the whole of
society in thorough accordance with reciprocity and
justice.</p>

<p>In the third congress, held at Brussels in September
1868, the socialistic principles which had all along been
implicitly contained in the aims and utterances of the
International received most explicit statement. Ninety-eight
delegates, representing England, France, Germany,
Belgium, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland, assembled at
<span class='pageno' title='185' id='Page_185'></span>
this congress. It resolved that mines and forests and
the land, as well as all the means of transport and
communication, should become the common property of
society or of the democratic State, and that they should
by the State be handed over to associations of workers,
who should utilise them under rational and equitable
conditions determined by society. It was further
resolved that the producers could gain possession of the
machines only through co-operative societies and the
organisation of the mutual credit system, the latter
clause being a concession apparently to the followers of
Proudhon. After proposing a scheme for the better
organising of strikes, the congress returned to the
question of education, particularly emphasising the fact
that an indispensable condition towards a thorough
system of scientific, professional, and productive instruction
was the reduction of the hours of labour.</p>

<p>The fundamental principle, ‘to labour the full product
of labour,’ was recognised in the following resolution:
‘Every society founded on democratic principles repudiates
all appropriation by capital, whether in the
form of rent, interest, profit, or in any other form or
manner whatsoever. Labour must have its full right
and entire reward.’</p>

<p>In view of the struggle imminent between France
and Germany, the congress made an emphatic declaration,
denouncing it as a civil war in favour of Russia,
and calling upon the workers to resist all war as
systematic murder. In case of war the congress
recommended a universal strike. It reckoned on the
<span class='pageno' title='186' id='Page_186'></span>
solidarity of the workers of all lands for this strike of
the peoples against war.</p>

<p>At the Congress of Basel in September 1869, little
remained for the International to accomplish in further
defining the socialistic position. The resolution for
transforming land from private to collective property
was repeated. A proposal to abolish the right of
inheritance failed to obtain a majority, for while thirty-two
delegates voted for the abolition, twenty-three were
against it, and seventeen declined to vote.<a id='r5_11'/><a href='#f5_11' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[5]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>If we now turn from the congresses of the International
to consider the history of its influence in
Europe, we shall see that its success was very considerable.
A conference of delegates of English Trade
Unions which met at Sheffield in 1866 most earnestly
enjoined the unions to join the International; and it
repeatedly gave real help to the English trade unionists
by preventing the importation of cheap labour from the
Continent. It gained a substantial success in the
effectual support of the bronze-workers at Paris during
their lock-out in 1867. At the beginning of 1868
one hundred and twenty-two working men’s societies
of South Germany, assembled at Nuremberg, declared
their adhesion to the International. In 1870
Cameron announced himself as the representative of
800,000 American workmen who had adopted its
principles.</p>

<p>It soon spread as far east as Poland and Hungary;
it had affiliated societies, with journals devoted to its
<span class='pageno' title='187' id='Page_187'></span>
cause, in every country of Western Europe. The leading
organs of the European press became more than
interested in its movements; the <span class='it'>Times</span> published four
leaders on the Brussels Congress. It was supposed to
be concerned in all the revolutionary movements and
agitations of Europe, thus gaining a world-historic
notoriety as the rallying-point of social overthrow and
ruin. Its prestige, however, was always based more on
the vast possibilities of the cause it represented than on
its actual power. Its organisation was loose, its financial
resources insignificant; the Continental unionists
joined it more in the hope of borrowing than of contributing
support.</p>

<p>In 1870 the International resolved to meet at the old
hearth of the revolutionary movement by holding its
annual congress in Paris. This plan was rendered
abortive by the Franco-German war. The war, however,
helped to bring the principles of the Association
more prominently before the world. During the Austro-German
struggle of 1866 the International had declared
its emphatic condemnation of war; and now the affiliated
societies of France and Germany, as well as the General
Council at London, uttered a solemn protest against a
renewal of the scourge. Some of its German adherents
likewise incurred the wrath of the authorities by venturing
to protest against the annexation of Alsace and
Lorraine.</p>

<p>All will agree that it is a happy omen for the
future that the democracy of labour as represented by
the International was so prompt and courageous in its
<span class='pageno' title='188' id='Page_188'></span>
denunciation of the evils of war. It gives us ground to
hope that as the influence of the democracy prevails in
the council of nations the passion for war may decline.
On this high theme no men have a better right to speak
than the workers, for they have in all ages borne the
heaviest of the burden of privation and suffering imposed
on the world by the military spirit, and have had the
least share in the miserable glories which victory may
obtain.</p>

<p>The relation of the International to the rising of the
Commune at Paris in 1871 is often misunderstood. It
is clear that the International, as such, had no part either
in originating or conducting the Commune; some of
the French members joined it, but only on their individual
responsibility. Its complicity after the event is
equally clear. After the fall of the Commune, Karl
Marx, in the name of the General Council, wrote a long
and trenchant manifesto commending it as substantially
a government of the working class, whose measures
tended really to advance the interests of the working
class. ‘The Paris of the workers, with its Commune,
will ever be celebrated as the glorious herald of a new
society. Its martyrs will be enshrined in the great
heart of the working class. History has already nailed
its destroyers on the pillory, from which all the prayers
of their priests are impotent to deliver them.’<a id='r6_11'/><a href='#f6_11' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[6]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>The Commune was undoubtedly a rising for the
autonomy of Paris, supported chiefly by the lower classes.
It was a protest against excessive centralisation raised
<span class='pageno' title='189' id='Page_189'></span>
by the democracy of Paris, which has always been far
in advance of the provinces, and which found itself in
possession of arms after the siege of the city by the
Germans. But while it was prominently an assertion
of local self-government, it was also a revolt against the
economic oppression of the moneyed classes. Many of
its measures were what we should call social-radical.</p>

<p>In two important points, therefore, the communal
rising at Paris had a very close affinity with socialism.
In the first place, it was a revolutionary assertion of
the Commune or local unit of self-government as the
cardinal and dominating principle of society over
against the State or central government. That is to
say, the Commune was a vindication of the political
form which is necessary for the development of socialism,
the self-governing group of workers. And in the
second place, the Commune was a rising chiefly of the
proletariat, the class of which socialism claims to be the
special champion, which in Paris only partially saw the
way of deliverance, but was weary of oppression, and
full of indignation against the middle-class adventurers
that had on the fall of the Empire seized the central
government of France.</p>

<p>It would, however, be a mistake to assume for the
Commune a clearness and comprehensiveness of aim
which it did not really possess. We should not be
justified in saying that the Commune had any definite
consciousness of such an historical mission as has been
claimed for it. The fearful shock caused by the overwhelming
events of the Franco-German war had naturally
<span class='pageno' title='190' id='Page_190'></span>
led to wide-spread confusion and uncertainty in
the French mind; and those who undertook to direct it,
whether in Paris or elsewhere, had painfully to grope
their way towards the renovation of the country. At a
time when it could hardly be said that France had a
regular government, the Commune seized the opportunity
to make a new political departure. The true
history of its doings will, we hope, be written after passion
and prejudice have sufficiently subsided to admit
of it. The story of its rise and fall was only one phase
of a sad series of troubles and disasters, which happily
do not often overtake nations in so terrible a form.</p>

<p>From this point the decline and fall of the Association
must be dated. The English trades unions, intent
on more practical concerns at home, never took a deep
interest in its proceedings; the German socialists were
disunited among themselves, lacking in funds, and
hampered by the police.</p>

<p>It found its worst enemies perhaps in its own
household. In 1869, Bakunin, with a following of
anarchists, had joined the International, and from the
first found themselves at variance with the majority led
by Marx. It can hardly be maintained that Marx
favoured a very strongly centralising authority, yet, as
his views and methods were naturally entirely repugnant
to the anarchists, a breach was inevitable.</p>

<p>The breach came at the Hague Congress in
September 1872. Sixty-five delegates were present,
including Marx himself, who with his followers, after
animated discussion, expelled the anarchist party, and
<span class='pageno' title='191' id='Page_191'></span>
then removed the seat of the General Council to New
York. The congress concluded with a meeting at
Amsterdam, of which the chief feature was a remarkable
speech from Marx. ‘In the eighteenth century,’
he said, ‘kings and potentates used to assemble at the
Hague to discuss the interests of their dynasties. At
the same place we resolved to hold the assize of
labour’—a contrast which with world-historic force did
undoubtedly mark the march of time. ‘He could not
deny that there were countries, like America, England—and,
as far as he knew its institutions, Holland also—where
the workmen could attain their goal by peaceful
means; but in most European countries force must be
the lever of revolution, and to force they must appeal
when the time came.’ Thus it was a principle of Marx
to prefer peaceful methods where peaceful methods are
permitted, but resort to force must be made when
necessary. Force also is an economic power. He
concluded by expressing his resolve that in the future,
as in the past, his life would be consecrated to the
triumph of the social cause.</p>

<p>The transfer of the General Council of the Marx
International from London to New York was the
beginning of the end. It survived just long enough
to hold another congress at Geneva in 1873, and then
quietly expired. The party of destruction, styling
themselves <span class='it'>autonomists</span> and led by Bakunin, had a
bloodier history. The programme of this party, as we
shall see in our chapter on Anarchism, was to overturn
all existing institutions, with the view to reconstructing
<span class='pageno' title='192' id='Page_192'></span>
them on a communal basis. This it endeavoured to
realise by the great communal risings in Southern Spain
in 1873, when its adherents set up their special form of
government at Barcelona, Seville, Cadiz, and Cartagena—at
the last-mentioned place also seizing on
part of the iron-clad fleet of Spain. The risings were
suppressed, not without difficulty, by the national
troops. The autonomists had a lingering existence
till 1879.</p>

<p>In its main practical aim, to serve as a common
centre for the combined efforts of working men of all
nations towards their universal emancipation, the
International had only a moderate and transitory
success. It was a great idea, for which the times were
not ripe. How effectually organise so many millions
of working men, of different countries, at different
stages of social development—men ignorant of each
other’s language, with little leisure, without funds for
travelling and purposes of propaganda? It was inevitable
that some such effort should be made; for we
need not repeat that labour has international interests
of vital and supreme importance. And men might have
expected that the attempt would be renewed. But on
the vast scale contemplated by the International it was
at least premature, and inasmuch as it drew the
attention of the workmen from practical measures to
far-distant and perhaps utopian aims, and engaged
them in revolutionary schemes for which the times
were not ready, even if they were otherwise desirable,
its influence was not salutary.
<span class='pageno' title='193' id='Page_193'></span></p>

<p>In a movement so momentous, however, it is
important to have taken the first step, and the International
took more than the first step. It proclaimed
a great cause in the face of the world—the cause of the
poor man, the cause of the suffering and oppressed
millions of labour. As an instrument of propaganda,
as a proclamation of a great cause with possibilities of
vast and continual growth, it has had a world-historic
significance, and teaches lessons from which all governments
and all men may learn. Its great mission was
propaganda, and in that it has succeeded marvellously.
Largely by means of it, the ideas of Marx and his
associates are making the tour of the world. The
governments most menaced by the social revolution,
and most antagonistic to its principles, must perforce
have regard to the questions raised by the International.
It is a movement that will not rest, but will
in many ways, and for many a year, claim the attention
of the world.</p>

<p>Though the International was dead, the forces which
gave it birth were still alive. The principles it proclaimed
continued to exercise the thoughts of men. It
had placed before the world a whole group of problems
for study, for experiment, to be pursued through doubt,
struggle, and agony, to some kind of wise and beneficial
solution, we fervently hope.</p>

<p>We should not be discouraged by the fact that the
efforts made for the solution of the questions of the
world have so often been so hopelessly incommensurate
with the greatness of the task which they attempted.
<span class='pageno' title='194' id='Page_194'></span></p>

<p>In beginning these high endeavours, men have always
been like children groping in the dark. Yet the
failures of one generation have frequently shown the
way to success in the next. The International attempted
the great task of the present epoch of the
world in its most difficult form. We need not be
surprised that its success was partial; and we may
with confidence expect that the lessons taught by it
will prove most helpful for the future.</p>

<p>In truth the International had only suffered a brief
eclipse. The various socialistic societies all over the
world continued to be fully conscious of the international
character of the movement in which they were
engaged. Without a formal organisation they represented
the claims and aspirations of the same class,
had common sympathies, and pursued like aims.
While differing greatly in methods of action, and even
in principle, they felt that they belonged to the same
stream of historic effort and tendency.</p>

<p>The international movement soon began again to find
expression in congresses representing the different countries.
Such was the congress at Ghent in 1877, which
was not marked by any noteworthy feature. Greater
than any socialist congress previously held were those
which assembled at Paris in 1889, the centenary of
the Revolution, on the 14th of July, the anniversary
of the fall of the Bastille. There were two congresses,
one representing, as far as any difference of principle
was concerned, the more uncompromising Marx school,
the other consisting of delegates who are not indisposed
<span class='pageno' title='195' id='Page_195'></span>
to co-operate with other democratic parties. But the
cleavage of principle was by no means definite; the
difference between the two meetings originated largely
in personal matters, especially as regards the French
socialist parties, which issued the invitations. The
immediate occasion of disagreement related to the
manner of proving the mandates of the members.
Both congresses advocated an energetic collectivism,
while both also urged more practical measures for the
protection of labour, such as Sunday rest, an eight-hours
working-day, etc. The Marx congress consisted
of 395 delegates, and the other congress of about six
hundred delegates from the various countries of the
civilised world.</p>

<p>International Congresses followed at Brussels in 1891,
at Zürich in 1893, and in London in 1896. Both at
Brussels and London there was much disorder, caused
chiefly by the presence of a considerable number of
delegates with anarchist sympathies, and proving too
clearly that the International of Workers was like the
Concert of Europe, not yet ready to march.</p>

<p>After being alarmed by an International of Workers,
the world was agreeably startled by the project for
an International of Governments. In 1889 the Swiss
Government brought forward a proposal for an International
Conference on Labour of the countries most
interested in industrial competition. The question
assumed a new aspect when, early in 1890, the young
German Emperor issued rescripts, one of which
contained the same proposal. Naturally, the matters
<span class='pageno' title='196' id='Page_196'></span>
presented for discussion by the Emperor covered only a
small part of the ground occupied by the International
of Workers. The protection of adult labour, except in
mines, was excluded from the business of the conference.
Sunday labour, the protection of women, children, and
young persons, were the chief questions laid before the
meeting. There can be no doubt that the conference
gave a much-needed and a beneficial stimulus to legislation
for the protection of labour in civilised countries,
though it by no means realised the sanguine expectations
that many formed regarding it.</p>

<p>The main result of the conference has been the
recognition by the Governments of the fact that there
are labour questions of vast importance, and that these
questions have international aspects which can no longer
be ignored. Let us hope that it may be the beginning
of better things. In the course of human improvement
we may hope that the question of the needs and rights
of labour will ever take a large place beside the concerns
of war and diplomacy, and that it will eventually
supersede them. The workers have a growing influence
at the elections in civilised countries. It is their duty
to press their just claims on the Governments, and so
to bring about that desirable consummation.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br/><br/>THE GERMAN SOCIAL DEMOCRACY</h2>

<p>To understand the modern development of Germany,
we must recall a few of the leading facts of its history.
German history is largely a record of disunion, and
this became chronic at the Reformation, which divided
the country between two conflicting forms of religion.
The religious struggle had its culmination and its
catastrophe in the Thirty Years’ War.</p>

<p>Seldom, if ever, in the history of the world, has a
calamity so awful befallen a people so highly endowed
and so well fitted to excel in all the paths of progress.
In every respect—economical, political, and moral—Germany
in the Thirty Years’ War received wounds
from which she has hardly recovered even to-day.
Division and weakness at home invited interference
and aggression from abroad. For generations it was the
corner-stone of French policy to foster the divisions of
Germany, and so to maintain her supremacy in Western
Europe.</p>

<p>The victories of the Great Frederick, the works of
her great writers—Lessing, Schiller, and Goethe, and of
her great philosophers—Kant, Fichte, Schelling, and
<span class='pageno' title='198' id='Page_198'></span>
Hegel, and the mighty struggles of the War of Liberation
in 1813, did much to restore the national consciousness
of Germany. But the disunion continued,
and in her industrial organisation she was far behind
England and France. Feudalism survived, especially
in the regions east of the Elbe, far into the nineteenth
century. The power-loom was not introduced, even
into the more progressive Rhine country, till the middle
of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>The results of the War of Liberation were, for the
German people, most disappointing. After throwing
off the French yoke, citizen and peasant alike found
that the enthusiasm and devotion with which they had
spent blood and treasure had been in vain. The
German princes took to themselves all the fruits of
victory, and the old abuses continued to flourish under
the old <span class='it'>régime</span>. The only considerable reforms were
those which had been established in the Rhine country
by the hereditary enemy, the French, and which the
German reaction did not venture to abolish.</p>

<p>In these circumstances we need not wonder that a
profound and brooding discontent began to occupy the
best German minds. A Fatherland which was disunited
at home and weak abroad, princely despotisms
which fostered servility and raised a barrier to progress,
backward methods and institutions which were all the
more galling when contrasted with the pre-eminence
which Germany had attained in literature and philosophy—how
could any patriot be satisfied with such a
wretched condition of affairs? Thus it happened that
<span class='pageno' title='199' id='Page_199'></span>
Germany took a leading part in the revolutionary
troubles of 1848. Both at Vienna and Berlin the old
<span class='it'>régime</span> was for a time overturned; and a national
Parliament met at Frankfort. But the German reformers
were not united; they had no clear aims; and
there was little or no material strength behind them.
The reaction had been taken by surprise. But it
wielded the organised military power, and so was able
to act whilst the Liberals talked and proposed. Before
the troubled year had come to a close the reaction was
triumphant both in Vienna and Berlin.</p>

<p>Then a time of darkness which could be felt, and
which apparently was as hopeless as ever, followed in
Germany. Parliaments were dispersed. Many who
had shared in the struggle were put to death or
imprisoned. In 1849 Switzerland counted within her
borders as many as 11,000 German refugees, most of
whom eventually found a home in America. It
appeared as if only one failure the more had been
made in the toilsome march of human progress.</p>

<p>But it was not an entire failure. The revolutionary
disturbances had at least proved that many of the old
institutions were untenable, and must in whole or in
part be removed. It was found necessary to make some
concessions to Liberalism. Much of the old feudalism
was set aside.</p>

<p>Above all, both in the middle and working class
there had arisen a new spirit which only awaited the
opportunity that was sure to come. The opportunity
arrived a few years afterwards, when the forces which
<span class='pageno' title='200' id='Page_200'></span>
have made the Germany of to-day came into action.
In the new circumstances it was an interesting question
how far the <span class='it'>bourgeoisie</span> and the working class could
march together. It is a standing charge brought
against German Liberalism by the Social Democrats,
that it has never led the progressive forces against the
reaction with any degree of courage or resolution.
They maintain that in the revolutionary struggles of
1848 the German Liberals never trusted the working
class, that when the choice came to be made between
the reaction and a strenuous democratic policy supported
by the proletariat, they preferred to transact with the
reaction, and so committed treason on the sacred cause
of progress. On this question largely turns the history
of recent German politics. It is a wide and complicated
question which can be rightly answered only
by due consideration of the facts of the historical
situation.</p>

<p>The middle class had triumphed both in France and
England. But the industrial revolution which naturally
brings with it the rule of the middle class, was in
Germany much later than in France and England. In
1848 the German middle class was still in its infancy,
and had neither the insight nor the material means to
lead the democracy against the reaction with any
prospect of success; nor was it reasonable to expect
that it should.</p>

<p>Further, it may be maintained that the German
working class, following the example of their French
brethren, has been too ready to enter on revolutionary
<span class='pageno' title='201' id='Page_201'></span>
courses, and by thus exciting the alarm and suspicion
of all sober-minded men, has done vital injury to the
cause of rational and hopeful progress. There can be
no doubt that for those who are bent on revolutionary
courses, and those who are content with what is usually
comprehended under the name of liberalism, the parting
of the ways must come sooner or later. That is no
reason why the parting should be premature. If they
can with mutual advantage make their way along a
common road against their common enemy, feudalism
and the reaction, why should they not do so?</p>

<p>Unfortunately for German Liberals and the energetic
Democratic party, there was no common way. The
parting came at the very outset, and it may be regarded
as inevitable. The chief aim of the Democrats was
universal suffrage, and for a time at least universal
suffrage in Germany, as in France, meant the strengthening
of Conservatism. In Germany, as in France, universal
suffrage would give the deciding power at the polls to
the peasantry and the rural population generally which
were under the control of the reaction, and which largely
outnumbered the urban population. The German
Liberals did not wish universal suffrage, as it was not
in their interest. They treated the working men and
their leaders with scant courtesy or consideration.
They wished to utilise them as subordinates, or, at the
best, as dependent allies. If the workmen were not
willing to be thus treated, the Liberals were ready to
show them the door.</p>

<p>The working men were not willing to be so treated,
<span class='pageno' title='202' id='Page_202'></span>
and they turned to Lassalle, with the result which we
have already briefly narrated. As time went on the
gulf between Liberals and Democrats widened, and the
democratic working men became Social Democrats. It
was a breach which may fairly be regarded as extremely
hurtful to the sound political development of Germany.
On one hand it has led to the result that the German
middle class has never with resolution and comprehensiveness
of purpose led the democracy along the path
on which a really free German State might have been
established. Partly from choice, partly from the
necessities of its position, the German middle class has
followed the policy of making for itself the best terms
it could with the reaction; and the socialists say that
this meant the sacrifice of democratic ideals to the
material interests of the middle class. ‘The treason of
the <span class='it'>bourgeoisie</span>,’ ‘the abdication by the <span class='it'>bourgeoisie</span>’ of its
historic place at the head of the democratic movement:
these phrases sum up the worst accusations brought
by the Social Democrats against the German middle
class.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the working men, finding themselves
neglected or repudiated by those who, according
to the natural laws of historical development, should
for a time at least have been their leaders, gave ear, it
may be prematurely, to men of revolutionary views and
antecedents like Lassalle and Karl Marx; and in this
manner was formed a revolutionary party which in
many ways has not had a salutary organic relation to
the main stream of German life. It is in fact the reaction
<span class='pageno' title='203' id='Page_203'></span>
which has profited by the division between the
<span class='it'>bourgeoisie</span> and the working class.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>We shall now return to the history of the Universal
Working Men’s Association which, as we have seen, was
founded by Lassalle in 1863.<a id='r1_12'/><a href='#f1_12' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a> At the death of the
founder in 1864 the membership of the Association
amounted to 4610, a small number, but we must
recollect that it had existed for only about fifteen
months.</p>

<p>Lassalle, in his will, had recommended as his successor
Bernhard Becker, a man totally unqualified for such a
difficult post. At the founding of the Association it
had been thought good that the president should
exercise a species of dictatorship. This arrangement
might be suitable so long as the office was filled by a
Lassalle. It was not easy to get a competent man of
any kind. In such a novel organisation we need not
say that there were hardly any members of ability and
experience. Lassalle’s choice was therefore extremely
limited. The most capable of his adherents undoubtedly
was Von Schweitzer, a young man who belonged to a
patrician house of Frankfort on the Main, but his
reputation was so far from stainless that the German
workmen for some time refused to have anything to do
with him. Becker was elected, and conducted the affairs
of the Association with more energy than wisdom,
<span class='pageno' title='204' id='Page_204'></span>
while the Countess Hatzfeldt, as the intimate friend of
Lassalle, used her wealth and social position to control
its fortunes in a way little calculated to satisfy the
self-respecting German working men. It was a time
of confusion and uncertainty in the Association; of
suspicion, jealousy, and contention among its leading
members. There would be no profit, however, in
narrating the squabbles which disturbed the progress
of the Association in its helpless infancy.</p>

<p>Indeed, if we consider the matter with some measure
of sympathy and impartiality, it would hardly have
been natural had it been otherwise. Let us try to
realise from what low estate the German working
men were now endeavouring to rise. We must remember
that the German workman had no share or
experience in government, either local or national. The
right of combination, of free speech in a free meeting,
and even of free movement, had been denied him for
generations. He could hardly turn to the right hand
or the left without coming into collision with the police
and the courts of law. He had no leaders whom he
could trust. The German working men, it is scarcely
an exaggeration to say, had in the sphere of social and
political action everything to learn. Under conditions
which were most trying and uncertain they had to
shape out a policy which suited their interests and
ideals; they had to learn to know each other and to
work in union, and they had to find trustworthy and
capable leaders.</p>

<p>Nameless misery and degradation prevailed in too
<span class='pageno' title='205' id='Page_205'></span>
many of the industrial regions on the Rhine in Saxony
and Silesia. Men, women, and children were worked
for fifteen hours a day. Hand labour was disappearing
with the wonted unspeakable suffering before the
machinery brought in by the industrial revolution.
Both the hand labour and the factory labour of
Germany suffered under the pressure of the competition
of the more advanced mechanical industry of
England.</p>

<p>In the lot of the German working man there had
been neither light, leading, nor hope. The men who
represented State and Church, law and learning, and
who should have been responsible for his guidance,
were too often found among his oppressors.</p>

<p>In view of facts like these need we wonder that
Lassalle, with all his eloquence and energy, found it
difficult to rouse the German working men out of their
apathy and hopelessness? Under such depressing circumstances
it was no particular disgrace for an ordinary
man like Bernhard Becker to fail. Becker’s tenure of
the presidency was of short duration. He was succeeded
by Tölcke, a man of ability and energy; but at his
entrance into office the prospects of the Association
were not bright. The funds in its treasury amounted
to only six thalers or eighteen shillings. If finance be
the test of success the Association founded by Lassalle
was indeed at a very low ebb.</p>

<p>The brightest feature in the early history of the
Association was the <span class='it'>Sozialdemokrat</span>, a paper founded
by Schweitzer at the end of 1864, and which had on
<span class='pageno' title='206' id='Page_206'></span>
its list of contributors the names of Marx and Engels.
But even here the evil fortune of the Association clung
to it. In a series of articles on Bismarck, Schweitzer
had given expression to views regarding that statesman
which were highly displeasing to the two revolutionists
in England, and they publicly renounced all connection
with the paper. Following Lassalle, Schweitzer had
shown his readiness to join hands with the Conservatives
of Prussia when circumstances made it advisable
in the interests of the Social Democracy. Such a policy
met with no favour in the eyes of Marx and Engels.
They demanded from Schweitzer the same energetic
opposition to the feudal and reactionary party as he
showed to the Progressists. Schweitzer claimed the
right to shape his tactics in accordance with the situation
of affairs in Prussia, which he knew better than
men living in exile. A socialist who could take a
lucid and comprehensive view of the theories which he
professed, a man of the world of real insight and tact,
Schweitzer, by his articles in the <span class='it'>Sozialdemokrat</span>, rendered
effectual service to the Association and to the
socialist cause in Germany at a most critical time in
their history.</p>

<p>During those years the political condition of
Germany was most uncertain and chaotic, and the
Association had to grope its way through the darkness
as best it could. It was a new party composed of
members who had no experience of common action,
and who had with much labour and perplexity to work
out a set of common convictions. Under the circumstances
<span class='pageno' title='207' id='Page_207'></span>
a clear line of policy was impossible. The first
mighty step out of this political chaos was made in
1866, when Bismarck, after defeating Austria, established
the North German Confederation. The elections
to the North German Diet, which was now established,
were based on universal suffrage. The first North
German Diet met in 1867, and in the same year
Schweitzer was elected president of the Association
founded by Lassalle. How were the Social Democrats
of Germany to relate themselves to the new order of
things? Before answering this question we must say
something of important movements which were proceeding
on the Social Democratic side.</p>

<p>The adherents of the Universal Working Men’s
Association were drawn chiefly from Prussia and
North Germany. In Saxony and South Germany
there had meanwhile grown up a new working men’s
party, from which Schweitzer encountered the most
strenuous opposition. Under the influence of the new
life which prevailed in Germany in the years following
1860, many workmen’s unions were established. As it
was dangerous to make too open a profession of a
political object these unions adopted the name of workmen’s
educative associations (<span class='it'>Arbeiterbildungsvereine</span>).
Some of these working men’s associations had attached
themselves to Lassalle, but from the first many had
held aloof from him. Many of these associations had
been founded and promoted under liberal democratic
influences, and their aim may generally be described as
political and educational rather than economical; but
<span class='pageno' title='208' id='Page_208'></span>
it would be more accurate still to describe them as
having no clear aims, and as on the look-out for a
policy rather than possessing one. It is certain that
as Saxons and South Germans they were to a large
degree inspired by the hatred to the growing ascendency
of Prussia which prevailed around them.</p>

<p>Shortly after the founding of the Lassalle Association
a Union of the working men’s associations which
continued loyal to the Progressist party was founded
at Frankfort in 1863, and was intended to form a
bulwark against the influence of Lassalle. But this
Union of associations speedily began to move in the
direction of democracy and through democracy to
socialism. Two men were chiefly responsible for this
result, Wilhelm Liebknecht and August Bebel.</p>

<p>Liebknecht had taken an active part in the revolutionary
disturbances in Germany in 1848, had been a
member of the group of exiles that gathered round
Karl Marx in London, and from him had imbibed the
principles of international revolutionary socialism. He
had joined the Universal Association of Lassalle, but
he never enjoyed the entire confidence of his chief.
Liebknecht counted Luther among his ancestors, and
was descended from the learned middle class of
Germany. His friend, August Bebel, was a working
man, who, being left an orphan at an early age, had
been educated at charity schools. Brought up to the
handicraft of turner, Bebel continued with the most
laudable diligence and thoroughness to educate himself.
By his acquirements, his natural talent and his force of
<span class='pageno' title='209' id='Page_209'></span>
character, he soon gained considerable influence among
his comrades. Bebel before long became a force in the
German workmen’s unions.</p>

<p>At first Bebel was merely a radical of strong convictions,
and he had no love for a socialistic agitation
like that of Lassalle which was to adapt itself so much
to Prussian nationalism. It was only a question
of time, however, when a nature so thorough and
strenuous would make the transition from radicalism to
socialism. As the representative man of the German
workmen’s educative associations, we see him making
his way in a few short years to Social Democracy, and
the associations followed him step by step. Influential
members soon expressed their preference for universal
suffrage. The Union of associations at its meeting in
Stuttgart in 1865 declared for universal suffrage, whilst
their organ in the same year repudiated the Schulze-Delitzsch
schemes in the most emphatic language. In
1866 a great meeting of workmen’s associations at
Chemnitz in Saxony adopted a programme which on
its political side was entirely democratic, and on its
economic side made considerable advances towards
socialism. At its congress in Nuremberg in 1868 the
Union by a large majority declared its adhesion to the
principles of the International. In a great congress at
Eisenach in 1869 they founded the Social Democratic
Working Men’s Party, and in the same year sent
representatives to the International Congress at Basel.
The Union which had been designed by the Progressists
as a bulwark against Social Democracy had proved a
<span class='pageno' title='210' id='Page_210'></span>
roadway by which the workmen marched into the
enemy’s camp.</p>

<p>Thus two socialist parties were established in
Germany, the Lassalle Association, which had its
membership chiefly in Prussia, and the Eisenach Party,
which found support in Saxony and South Germany.
Both parties were represented in the North German
Diet, in which at one time as many as six socialists sat.
They now had a tribune from which to address the
German people, but it cannot be said that they were
particularly grateful to Bismarck for the opportunity
which he had given them. To men of the revolutionary
party of 1848, whose ideal had been the unification of
Germany under the free initiative of the people, the
work of Bismarck could not appear a very delightful
consummation, even though it was accompanied with
the gift of universal suffrage. Schweitzer regarded the
North German Confederation as a very unpleasant and
very unwelcome, but yet irrevocable fact, with which
the Social Democracy would need to find a way of
getting on, on whose basis they would have to establish
themselves as the extreme opposition if they wished to
continue a political party.</p>

<p>Liebknecht, on the other hand, looked upon the
North German Confederation as a reactionary work of
violence and injustice that must be overthrown. In
order not to strengthen it he repudiated all practical
participation in the legislative measures of the Diet.
The parliamentary tribune was only a platform from
which he could hurl his protest against the new arrangement
<span class='pageno' title='211' id='Page_211'></span>
of things among the masses of the German people.
In his opinion the creation of Bismarck meant the
division, weakening, and servitude of Germany, and
history would march over its ruins.</p>

<p>During the Franco-German War of 1870-71 the
flood of patriotic enthusiasm for a time almost submerged
the socialistic agitation. At the commencement
of hostilities Liebknecht and Bebel refrained from voting
on the question of a war loan; they disapproved alike
of the policy of Prussia and of Bonaparte. The other
socialist deputies, including Schweitzer, voted for it, as
the victory of Napoleon would mean the overthrow of
the socialist workmen in France, the supremacy of the
Bonapartist soldiery in Europe, and the complete disintegration
of Germany. But after the fall of the
French Empire all of them voted against a further loan
and recommended the speediest conclusion of peace
with the Republic, without annexation of French territory.
Such views did not meet with much acceptance
in Germany, either from Government or people. Several
of the socialist leaders were thrown into prison. At
the first election to the German Reichstag in 1871 the
socialists counted only 102,000 votes, and returned two
members.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards Schweitzer announced his intention
of retiring from the leadership of the Universal Working
Men’s Association. He had been defeated at the
general election. His position at the head of the
Association, which, as we have seen, was a species of
dictatorship, was no longer tenable. His trials and
<span class='pageno' title='212' id='Page_212'></span>
struggles with the Prussian police and courts of justice,
the troubles he experienced in the midst of his own
party, the persecution and calumny which he endured
from the opposing Eisenach party, the sacrifice of time
and money, of health and quiet, which were inseparable
from such a post, had made it a very uneasy one. He
had conducted the affairs of the Association with a tact,
insight, and appreciation of the situation to which his
successors in the leadership of the German socialists
have apparently never been able to attain. He died in
Switzerland in 1875.</p>

<p>About the same time, in the spring of 1871, came
the tidings of the great rising of the working class in
the Commune at Paris. Mass meetings of German
workmen were held in Berlin, Hamburg, Hanover,
Dresden, Leipzic, and other large towns, to express their
sympathy with their French brethren in the struggle
which they were waging. In the Reichstag Bebel made
a speech which contained the following passage:—‘Be
assured that the entire European proletariat, and all
that have a feeling for freedom and independence in
their heart, have their eyes fixed on Paris. And if
Paris is for the present crushed, I remind you that the
struggle in Paris is only a small affair of outposts, that
the main conflict in Europe is still before us, and that
ere many decades pass away the battle-cry of the
Parisian proletariat, war to the palace, peace to the
cottage, death to want and idleness, will be the battle-cry
of the entire European proletariat.’<a id='r2_12'/><a href='#f2_12' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a></p>

<p><span class='pageno' title='213' id='Page_213'></span></p>

<p>When the war fever of 1871 subsided the socialistic
agitation resumed its course, and it was fostered by the
wild speculations of the time, and by the industrial crisis
which followed it. At the elections of 1874 the socialist
party polled 340,000 votes and returned nine members.</p>

<p>From Lassalle’s first appearance on the scene in
1862, the socialistic agitation had encountered the
German police at every step of its career. Its leaders
were prosecuted and thrown into prison. Meetings
were broken up, newspapers and organisations were
suppressed. The free expression of opinion on the
platform and through the press was curtailed in every
way.</p>

<p>Such experience taught the socialist leaders the
advantage and necessity of union in face of the common
enemy. The retirement of Schweitzer from the control
of the Lassalle party in 1871 had removed the
most serious obstacle to union. Hasenclever had been
elected president in his stead, but it was felt that the
party had outgrown the autocratic guidance which had
been helpful and perhaps necessary to it in its early
years. All the tendencies and influences of the time
served to bring the Lassalle and the Eisenach parties
together. They were pursuing the same aims under
the same conditions, against the same opposition; and
there was really nothing now to keep them apart except
the recollection of old rivalries and animosities which
soon faded under the pressure of their practical difficulties.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances the process of union was
<span class='pageno' title='214' id='Page_214'></span>
easy, and the fusion of the Eisenach and Lassalle parties
was effected in a congress at Gotha in 1875. At this
congress 25,000 regular members were represented, of
whom 9000 belonged to the Marx party and 15,000 to
that of Lassalle. The united body assumed the name
of the Socialistic Working Men’s Party of Germany,
and drew up a programme, which, as the most important
that till that time had been published by any
socialistic organisation, deserves to be given entire.<a id='r3_12'/><a href='#f3_12' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>The union of the two parties thus accomplished was
the starting-point of a new career of prosperity for the
German Social Democracy. At the election of 1877 the
new party polled nearly half a million votes, and returned
twelve members to the Reichstag. This result
was largely due to the admirable organisation to which
the socialistic propaganda had now attained. A staff of
skilful, intelligent, and energetic agitators advocated
the new creed in every town of Germany, and they
were supported by an effective machinery of newspapers,
pamphlets, treatises, social gatherings, and even
almanacs, in which the doctrines of socialism were suggested,
inculcated, and enforced in every available way.
At all the great centres of population—in Berlin, Hamburg,
and in the industrial towns of Saxony and on the
Rhine—the Social Democrats threatened to become the
strongest party.</p>

<p>Such a rate of progress, and the aggressive attitude
of the spokesmen of the party, naturally awakened the
apprehensions of the German rulers. They resolved to
<span class='pageno' title='215' id='Page_215'></span>
meet it by special legislation. The Social Democrat
programme contained nothing that was absolutely inconsistent
with the idea of a peaceful development out
of the existing state. As we have seen, it is a principle
of the Marx socialism that its realisation depends on
the inherent tendencies of social evolution; but the
process can be hastened by the intelligent and energetic
co-operation of living men, and as this co-operation may
take the shape of revolutionary force, and was actually
in Germany assuming a most aggressive and menacing
attitude, both on the platform and in the press, it was
inevitable that the German Government should adopt
measures to repress it.</p>

<p>The occasion of the anti-socialist legislation was found
in the attempts of Hödel and Nobiling on the Emperor’s
life in 1878. It is needless to say that neither attempt
was authorised by the Social Democratic party. The
two men had no official connection with the party.
Both were weak in character and intellect. Their feeble
brains had been excited by the socialistic doctrines
which were fermenting around them. No further responsibility
for their acts attaches to the Social Democratic
party, whose principles and interests were entirely
opposed to such attempts at assassination.</p>

<p>The Bill introduced after the attempt of Hödel was
rejected by the Reichstag. On the attempt of Nobiling
the Government dissolved the Reichstag and appealed
to the country, with the result that a large majority
favourable to exceptional legislation was returned. At
the general election the socialist vote declined from
<span class='pageno' title='216' id='Page_216'></span>
493,000 to 437,000. Severe anti-socialist laws were
speedily carried by the new Reichstag.</p>

<p>A most interesting feature of the discussions which
took place in connection with the exceptional legislation
was the attitude of Bismarck. Now when the
great statesman is no more it is specially necessary to
state that he approached the subject of socialism with
an open-mindedness which does him honour. He felt
it his duty to make himself acquainted with all the
facts relating to his office, and took particular pains to
understand the new social and economic problems which
were engaging the attention of the country.</p>

<p>In a sitting of the Reichstag on September 17, 1878,
he did not hesitate to express his sympathy and even
respect for Lassalle. He explained how he had met
Lassalle three or four times at the request of the latter,
and had not regretted it. Referring to baseless rumours
that had been circulated to the effect that he had been
willing to enter into negotiation with the agitator, he
stated that their relations could not have taken the
form of a political transaction, for Lassalle had nothing
to offer him, and there could be no bargain when one of
the parties had nothing to give. ‘But Lassalle had
something,’ Bismarck went on to say, ‘that attracted
me exceedingly as a private man. He was one of the
cleverest and most amiable men with whom I ever met;
a man who was ambitious in great style, and by no
means a republican; he had a very strongly marked
national and monarchical feeling, the idea which he
strove to realise was the German Empire, and therein
<span class='pageno' title='217' id='Page_217'></span>
we had common ground. Lassalle was ambitious in the
grand style; it was doubtful, perhaps, whether the
German Empire should close with the Hohenzollern
dynasty or the dynasty Lassalle, yet his feeling was
monarchical through and through.... Lassalle was an
energetic and most intellectual man, whose conversation
was very instructive; our talks lasted for hours,
and I always regretted when they came to an end....
I should have been glad to have had a man of such endowments
and genius as neighbouring landlord.’</p>

<p>It should be added also that Bismarck saw no objection
in principle to the scheme of productive associations
with State help recommended by Lassalle. Such experiments
were not unreasonable in themselves, and
were entirely consistent with the range of duties recognised
by the State as he understood them; but the
course of political events had not left him the necessary
leisure. Before leaving this matter we should note
that, as regards universal suffrage and the scheme of
productive associations with State help, Bismarck and
Lassalle had common ground, on which they could have
co-operated without sacrifice of principle on either side.</p>

<p>In his speech in the Reichstag of September 17,
1878, the Chancellor also explained the origin of his
hostility to the Social Democracy. One of its leading
representatives, either Bebel or Liebknecht, had in open
sitting expressed his sympathy with the Commune at
Paris. That reference to the Commune had been a ray
of light on the question; from that time he felt entirely
convinced that the Social Democracy was an enemy
<span class='pageno' title='218' id='Page_218'></span>
against which the State and society must arm themselves.</p>

<p>As we have seen, it was Bebel who had used the
objectionable language in the Reichstag; but Liebknecht
had never been backward in the frank and uncompromising
expression of views of a similar nature. Such
views were not the passing feeling of the hour; they
were the statement of firm and settled conviction, and
may fairly be taken as representative of the beliefs and
convictions of the German Social Democracy in general.
The Social Democrats were hostile to the existing order
in Germany, and they did not hesitate to say so. In
these circumstances it is hardly necessary to say that
a collision with a Government like that directed by
Bismarck was inevitable.</p>

<p>Bismarck himself was a Prussian Junker who had
become a great European statesman, but in many ways
he remained a Junker to the end of his life. With
rare sagacity and strength of will he had shaped the
real forces of his time towards the great end of uniting
the Fatherland and restoring it to its fitting place
among the nations of Europe. To use his own words,
he had lifted Germany into the saddle, and his task
afterwards was to keep her there. The methods, however,
by which he had accomplished the first part of his
task, were scarcely so suitable for the accomplishment
of the second.</p>

<p>In the now united Germany he found two enemies
which appeared to menace the new structure which he
had so laboriously reared, the Black International, or
<span class='pageno' title='219' id='Page_219'></span>
the Ultramontane party, and the Red International, or
the Social Democrats. These enemies he tried to suppress
by the high-handed methods which had been
familiar to him from his youth. He was about fifty-six
years of age when the German Empire was established.
It was too much to expect of human nature that he
should at so late a time of life break away from his
antecedents as Prussian Junker and statesman, and
adopt the methods which would make Germany a free
as well as a united State.</p>

<p>Yet it is only right to say that he went a considerable
distance on this desirable path. Both as realist
statesman and as patriot he wished to have the German
people on his side. When he attempted to suppress the
Social Democracy by methods which are not worthy of
a free and enlightened nation, he did so in all seriousness,
as a German patriot. He was a man working
under the human limitations of his birth, antecedents,
and position. On the other hand, the Social Democrats
had endured oppression for many generations from the
classes which Bismarck represented. They had now
risen in anger out of the lower depths of society as an
organised party, demanding that the hereditary oppression
should cease. Considered in this aspect the anti-socialist
legislation of Bismarck was only a new phase
in a secular process. Time has not yet fully revealed
the means by which a process of this kind can be
brought to a close.</p>

<p>The anti-socialist laws came into force in October
1878. Socialist newspapers and meetings were at once
<span class='pageno' title='220' id='Page_220'></span>
suppressed, and the organisation of the party was
broken up. Generally, it may be said that during the
operation of the laws the only place in Germany in
which the right of free speech could be exercised by
the socialists was the tribune of the Reichstag, and the
only organisation permitted to them was that formed
by the representatives of the party in the Reichstag.
As time went on the minor state of siege was established
in Berlin, Hamburg, Leipzig, and other towns, and
the police did not hesitate to exercise the power thereby
put into their hands of expelling Social Democratic
agitators and others who might be objectionable to them.</p>

<p>For some time confusion, and to some extent dismay,
prevailed among the Social Democrats. But ere long
they found that their union and their power did not
depend on any formal organisation. As Marx had
taught, the organisation of the factory necessarily brings
with it the organisation of the proletariat. A well-drilled
working class is a natural and inevitable result
of modern industrial evolution, which no <span class='it'>fiat</span> of the law
can disturb, if the workmen have the intelligence to
understand their position and mission. Thus the
German workman realised that the union in which he
trusted was beyond the reach of repressive laws, however
cunningly devised and however brutally exercised.</p>

<p>The want of an organ, however, was greatly felt,
and accordingly, in September 1879, the <span class='it'>Socialdemocrat,
International Organ of the Socialdemocracy of
German Tongue</span>, was founded at Zürich. From 1880
it was edited by Eduard Bernstein with real ability
<span class='pageno' title='221' id='Page_221'></span>
and conscientious thoroughness. Every week thousands
of copies were despatched to Germany, and, in spite of
all the efforts of the police, were distributed among the
Social Democrats in the Fatherland. In 1888 it was
removed to London, whence it was issued till the repeal
of the anti-socialist laws in 1890.</p>

<p>The efforts of Bismarck against socialism apparently
had a temporary success, for in 1881, the first election
after the passing of the laws, the voting power of the
party sank to about 312,000. But it was only temporary,
and probably it was more apparent than real.
The elections in 1884 showed a marked increase to
549,000, and in 1887 to 763,000. These symptoms of
growth, however, were vastly exceeded by the results
of the poll in 1890, when the number of Social Democratic
votes swelled to 1,427,000. They were now the
strongest single party of the Empire.</p>

<p>In all the large towns of the Empire, and especially
in the largest of all, such as Berlin, Hamburg, and
Leipzig, where the minor state of siege had been proclaimed,
the socialists could show an enormous increase
of votes. Till about 1885 the Social Democrats had,
by their own confession, made very little progress in
country districts, or among the Catholic population
either of town or country. At the election of 1890
there was evidence of a very considerable advance in
both quarters. The election sounded the knell of
Bismarck’s system of repression, and the anti-socialist
laws were not renewed.</p>

<p>The Social Democrats thus came out of the struggle
<span class='pageno' title='222' id='Page_222'></span>
against Bismarck with a voting power three times as
great as it had been when the anti-socialist laws were
passed. The struggle had proved the extraordinary
vitality of the movement. The Social Democrats had
shown a patience, resolution, discipline, and, in the
absence of any formal organisation, a real and effective
organisation of mind and purpose which are unexampled
in the annals of the labour movement since
the beginning of human society. They had made a
steady and unflinching resistance to the most powerful
statesman since the first Napoleon, who wielded all
the resources of a great modern State, and who was
supported by a press that used every available means
to discredit the movement; and, as a party, they had
never been provoked to acts of violence. In fact, they
had given proof of all the high qualities which fit men
and parties to play a great <span class='it'>rôle</span> in history. The Social
Democratic movement in Germany is one of the most
notable phenomena of our time.</p>

<p>After the anti-social legislation had ceased the
Social Democratic party found that its first task was
to set its house in order. At a party meeting at Halle
in 1890 an organisation of the simplest kind was
adopted. The annual meeting forms the highest representative
body of the party. The party direction was
to consist of two chairmen, two secretaries, one treasurer,
and also of two assessors chosen by a Board
of Control of seven members. The <span class='it'>Sozialdemokrat</span>,
which, as we have seen, had for some time been
published in London, was discontinued, and the
<span class='pageno' title='223' id='Page_223'></span>
<span class='it'>Vorwärts</span> of Berlin was appointed the central organ of
the party.</p>

<p>In 1891, at the party meeting at Erfurt, a new programme,
superseding that of Gotha, was adopted; and
as it may fairly be regarded as the most developed
expression of the Social Democratic principles yet
put forth by any body of working men, we give
it here entire for the perusal and study of our
readers.<a id='r4_12'/><a href='#f4_12' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[4]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>‘The economic development of the <span class='it'>bourgeois</span> society
leads by a necessity of nature to the downfall of the
small production, the basis of which is the private
property of the workman in his means of production.
It separates the workman from his means of production,
and transforms him into a proletarian without property,
whilst the means of production become the monopoly
of a comparatively small number of capitalists and
great landowners.</p>

<p>‘This monopolising of the means of production is
accompanied by the supplanting of the scattered small
production through the colossal great production, by
the development of the tool into the machine, and
by gigantic increase of the productivity of human
labour. But all advantages of this transformation are
monopolised by the capitalists and great landowners.
For the proletariat and the sinking intermediate grades—small
tradesmen and peasant proprietors—it means
increasing insecurity of their existence, increase of
<span class='pageno' title='224' id='Page_224'></span>
misery, of oppression, of servitude, degradation, and
exploitation.</p>

<p>‘Ever greater grows the number of the proletarians,
ever larger the army of superfluous workmen, ever
wider the chasm between exploiters and exploited,
ever bitterer the class struggle between <span class='it'>bourgeoisie</span>
and proletariat, which divides modern society into two
hostile camps, and is the common characteristic of all
industrial lands.</p>

<p>‘The gulf between rich and poor is further widened
through the crises which naturally arise out of the
capitalistic method of production, which always become
more sweeping and destructive, which render the
general insecurity the normal condition of society, and
prove that the productive forces have outgrown the
existing society, that private property in the means of
production is incompatible with their rational application
and full development.</p>

<p>‘Private property in the instruments of production,
which in former times was the means of assuring to
the producer the property in his own product, has now
become the means of expropriating peasant proprietors,
hand-workers, and small dealers, and of placing the
non-workers, capitalists, and great landowners in the
possession of the product of the workmen. Only the
conversion of the capitalistic private property in the
means of production—land, mines, raw material, tools,
machines, means of communication—into social property,
and the transformation of the production of wares
into socialistic production, carried on for and through
<span class='pageno' title='225' id='Page_225'></span>
society, can bring it about that the great production
and the continually increasing productivity of social
labour may become for the hitherto exploited classes,
instead of a source of misery and oppression, a source
of the highest welfare and of all-sided harmonious
development.</p>

<p>‘This social transformation means the emancipation,
not merely of the proletariat, but of the entire human
race which suffers under the present conditions. But
it can only be the work of the labouring class, because
all other classes, in spite of their mutually conflicting
interests, stand on the ground of private property in
the means of production, and have as their common
aim the maintenance of the bases of the existing society.</p>

<p>‘The struggle of the working class against capitalistic
exploitation is of necessity a political struggle. The
working class cannot conduct its economic struggle,
and cannot develop its economic organisation, without
political rights. It cannot effect the change of the
means of production into the possession of the collective
society without coming into possession of political
power.</p>

<p>‘To shape this struggle of the working class into a
conscious and united one, and to point out to it its
inevitable goal, this is the task of the Social Democratic
party.</p>

<p>‘In all lands where the capitalistic method of production
prevails, the interests of the working classes
are alike. With the extension of the world commerce
and of the production for the world market, the condition
<span class='pageno' title='226' id='Page_226'></span>
of the workmen of every single land always
grows more dependent on the condition of the workmen
in other lands. The emancipation of the working class
is therefore a task in which the workers of all civilised
countries are equally interested. Recognising this the
Social Democratic party of Germany feels and declares
itself at one with the class-conscious workers of all
other countries.</p>

<p>‘The Social Democratic party of Germany therefore
contends, not for new class privileges and exclusive
rights, but for the abolition of class rule and of classes
themselves, and for equal rights and equal duties of all
without distinction of sex and descent. Proceeding
from these views it struggles in the present society,
not only against exploitation and oppression of the
wage-workers, but against every kind of exploitation
and oppression, whether directed against class, party,
sex, or race.</p>

<p>‘Proceeding from these principles the Social Democratic
party of Germany now demands—</p>

<p>‘1. Universal, equal, and direct suffrage, with vote by
ballot, for all men and women of the Empire over
twenty years of age. Proportional electoral system;
and, till the introduction of this, legal redistribution
of seats after every census. Biennial legislative
periods. Elections to take place on a legal
day of rest. Payment of representatives. Abolition
of all limitation of political rights, except in
the case of disfranchisement.</p>

<p>‘2. Direct legislation through the people, by means of
<span class='pageno' title='227' id='Page_227'></span>
the right of proposal and rejection. Self-government
of the people in Empire, State, Province,
and Commune. Officials to be elected by the
people; responsibility of officials. Yearly granting
of taxes.</p>

<p>‘3. Training in universal military duty. A people’s
army in place of the standing armies, decision
on peace and war by the representatives of the
people. Settlement of all international differences
by arbitration.</p>

<p>‘4. Abolition of all laws which restrict or suppress the
free expression of opinion and the right of union
and meeting.</p>

<p>‘5. Abolition of all laws which, in public or private
matters, place women at a disadvantage as compared
with men.</p>

<p>‘6. Religion declared to be a private matter. No public
funds to be applied to ecclesiastical and religious
purposes. Ecclesiastical and religious bodies are
to be regarded as private associations which manage
their own affairs in a perfectly independent manner.</p>

<p>‘7. Secularisation of the school. Obligatory attendance
at the public people’s schools. Education, the
appliances of learning, and maintenance free in
the public people’s schools, as also in the higher
educational institutions for those scholars, both
male and female, who, by reason of their talents,
are thought to be suited for further instruction.</p>

<p>‘8. Administration of justice and legal advice to be free.
Justice to be administered by judges chosen by
<span class='pageno' title='228' id='Page_228'></span>
the people. Appeal in criminal cases. Compensation
for those who are innocently accused, imprisoned,
and condemned. Abolition of capital
punishment.</p>

<p>‘9. Medical treatment, including midwifery and the
means of healing, to be free. Free burial.</p>

<p>‘10. Progressive income and property taxes to meet
all public expenditure, so far as these are to be
covered by taxation. Duty of making one’s own
return of income and property. Succession duty to
be graduated according to amount and relationship.
Abolition of all indirect taxes, customs, and other
financial measures which sacrifice the collective
interest to the interests of a privileged minority.</p>

<p>‘For the protection of the working class the Social
Democratic party of Germany demands—</p>

<p>‘1. An effective national and international protective
legislation for workmen on the following bases:—</p>

<p>‘(<span class='it'>a</span>) Fixing of a normal working day of not more
than eight hours.</p>

<p>‘(<span class='it'>b</span>) Prohibition of money-making labour of
children under fourteen years.</p>

<p>‘(<span class='it'>c</span>) Prohibition of night work, except for those
branches of industry which from their
nature, owing to technical reasons or
reasons of public welfare, require night
work.</p>

<p>‘(<span class='it'>d</span>) An unbroken period of rest of at least thirty-six
hours in every week for every worker.</p>

<p>‘(<span class='it'>e</span>) Prohibition of the truck system.
<span class='pageno' title='229' id='Page_229'></span></p>

<p>‘2. Supervision of all industrial establishments, investigation
and regulation of the conditions of labour
in town and country by an imperial labour department,
district labour offices, and labour chambers.
A thorough system of industrial hygiene.</p>

<p>‘3. Agricultural labourers and servants to be placed on
the same footing as industrial workers; abolition
of servants’ regulations.</p>

<p>‘4. The right of combination to be placed on a sure
footing.</p>

<p>‘5. Undertaking of the entire working men’s insurance
by the Empire, with effective co-operation of the
workmen in its administration.’</p>

<p>If we consider the above programme we shall see
that collectivism is set forth as the goal of a long
process of historical evolution. But this goal is to be
attained by the conscious, intelligent, and organised
action of the working class of Germany in co-operation
with the working classes of other lands. This is the
twofold theme of the first part of the programme.
The second part is a detailed statement of the social-political
arrangements and institutions, by which on
and from the basis of the existing society the German
Social Democracy may move towards the goal. The
goal, collectivism, is therefore the central point of the
programme.</p>

<p>The programme, it will be observed, is a lengthy
one about which many treatises might be written, and
indeed it sums up a world of thought, on which the
Social Democratic mind has been exercised for more
<span class='pageno' title='230' id='Page_230'></span>
than a generation. It will be seen that the materialistic
conception of history and the theory of surplus
value of Marx are not expressed in the programme,
though they <span class='it'>may</span> be taken as underlying it by those
who emphasise those two leading principles of Marx.
The Social Democracy of Germany, therefore, is not
committed to the special theories of Marx to the extent
that is commonly supposed, though the general lines
on which the programme is constructed owe their
elucidation greatly more to him than to any other man.
The various points of the programme will, we may
be assured, be subjects of discussion and of education
for the industrious and intelligent working class of
Germany for many a year to come. It embodies their
thoughts and interests, their aspirations and ideals, in
the social economic and political sphere, but it represents
no fixed system of dogma. It is meant to be a
living creed, mirroring a living movement.</p>

<p>We have thus briefly sketched the rise of the
German Social Democratic party from 1863 to 1890.
It is a short period, but full of change and trouble.
The party has come victoriously through a very hard
school. We have seen how low and feeble were the
beginnings of the party. We have seen also how hard
at every step of its career has been its experience of
the German police. Indeed the Prussian and German
executive has left no means untried to suppress and
destroy the movement.</p>

<p>Looking back on the development of the party we
cannot doubt that at certain decisive stages greater
<span class='pageno' title='231' id='Page_231'></span>
wisdom and insight might have been shown by its
leaders. The ascendency of Prussia should have been
recognised as an inevitable fact which unquestionably
made for progress in the unification of Germany. In
this aspect at least the work of Bismarck was profoundly
progressive. We may safely assume that the unification
and regeneration of Germany would never have been
accomplished by a talking apparatus like the Frankfort
Parliament of 1848; and we can see no other force that
could have succeeded except the military power of
Prussia. And we may further add that the present
policy of the Social Democratic party in refusing to
vote for the budgets, if it were seriously to weaken
the German executive, would in the existing state of
Europe be disastrous in the last degree. That men
like Liebknecht should hate the Junker party as the
hereditary oppressors of the poor was natural; but
the Junkers have had and still have a great historic
function as the heads of the forces political and military
which have again made Germany a nation. Their way
of making the new Germany has not been the ideal
way, let us say; but it has been the way of fact,
and no exercise of revolutionary impatience of Marx
or Liebknecht has been able to arrest or reverse the
fact.</p>

<p>Trained in the school of adversity, the German Social
Democratic party has been obliged to learn circumspection
and to acquire all the virtues of discipline,
patience, sobriety, and self-control. Some of its members,
among whom Most and Hasselman were prominent,
<span class='pageno' title='232' id='Page_232'></span>
strongly urged a policy of anarchic resistance to
authority, but this tendency was strenuously opposed
by the vast majority. Most and Hasselman, on refusing
to submit to the party discipline, were eventually
expelled. Every attempt to encourage the theory or
practice of anarchism in the German Social Democratic
party has been sternly and almost unanimously suppressed
by the party. It succeeded only to a slight
degree in cases where it was promoted by the agents of
the German police for their own evil ends.</p>

<p>A most wholesome effect of the adverse experience
of the Social Democratic party was that it sifted from
their ranks all who were not thoroughly in earnest in
the cause of the working man. It is a grave misfortune
of new movements like socialism that it attracts from
the middle and upper classes all manner of faddists and
crotchety enthusiasts and adventurers, vapid and futile
talkers, acrid and morbid pessimists, who join the
movement, not from real love of the cause, but because
it gives them an opportunity to scheme and harangue,
and to lash out at the vices of the existing society.
From this dangerous class the German Social Democratic
party was saved by the anti-socialist legislation
at a time when socialism was becoming fashionable.</p>

<p>It is a most significant feature in the development
of the German Social Democracy that it has attained
to its present advanced position without the help of
any leader of commanding talent. It has had many
loyal chiefs. For over fifty years, during which exile,
privation, discouragement, prosecution, and imprisonment
<span class='pageno' title='233' id='Page_233'></span>
were followed by a season of comparative
triumph, Liebknecht was at all times the consistent
and unflinching champion of the revolutionary cause.
Bebel’s service for the working man now extends to
about forty years, and has been not less consistent and
courageous. Many others, such as Hasenclever, Auer,
and Vollmar, have served with ability for many years.
But none of those named can be considered men of
remarkable gifts. Bernstein and Kautsky, who may
be described as the leading theorists of the party in
recent years, have shown wide knowledge, judgment,
and clearness of vision, but they would be the last to lay
claim to the endowments that give Marx and Lassalle
their high place in the history of the working class.
These things being so, we must regard the German
Social Democracy as a movement which owes its rise
no doubt to the initiative of two men of original force,
but which in its development finds its basis in the
minds and hearts of the proletariat of the Fatherland.</p>

<p>In the absence of other guidance the Social Democratic
party has been a centre and a rallying-point to
the German workmen. While all else was uncertain,
dark, and hostile, the party could be relied upon to give
friendly and disinterested counsel. The strikes which
from time to time broke out among the German workmen
received the most careful advice and consideration
from the Social-Democratic leaders, and those leaders
soon found that the strikes were the most impressive
object-lessons in arousing the class-consciousness of the
workmen. Whole masses of the working men went
<span class='pageno' title='234' id='Page_234'></span>
over to the Social Democracy under the severe practical
teaching of the strike.</p>

<p>The cause of the German Social Democracy has
therefore called forth the most entire devotion among
all ranks of its members. When Liebknecht and Bebel
were condemned to two years’ imprisonment in a
fortress after the great trial at Leipzig, in 1872, they
were glad, they said, to do their two years because of
the splendid opportunity it had given them for socialistic
propaganda in the face of Germany. During the fortnight
the trial had lasted they had in the course of
their defence been able to dispel prejudices and misunderstandings,
and so to educate German opinion in
socialism.</p>

<p>But the 10th of March 1878 saw a demonstration
which of all the events and incidents in the history of
the German Social Democracy may well be regarded as
the most deeply significant. It was the funeral of
August Heinsch. August Heinsch was a simple workman,
a compositor; but he had deserved well of the
proletariat by organising its electoral victories in Berlin.
He had died of consumption, called by the socialists the
proletarian malady, because it is so frequently due to
the insanitary conditions under which work is carried
on. In the case of August Heinsch the malady was at
least aggravated by his self-sacrificing exertions in the
common cause, and the workmen of Berlin resolved to
honour his memory by a solemn and imposing demonstration.
As the body was borne to the cemetery
through the working men’s districts in East Berlin,
<span class='pageno' title='235' id='Page_235'></span>
black flags waved from the roofs and windows, and the
vast crowds of people, reckoned by the hundred
thousand, who filled the streets, bared their heads in
respectful sympathy. Many thousands of workmen
followed the bier in serried ranks to the last resting-place.</p>

<p>Of all the achievements of the German Social
Democracy it may be reckoned the most signal that it
has so organised the frugal, hard-working and law-abiding
proletariat of the Fatherland, and has inspired
them with the spirit of intelligent self-sacrifice in their
common cause. The programme and principles of the
party have received modification in the past, and will
no doubt receive it in the future, for the German Social
Democracy is a reality and a movement instinct with
vitality. The new times will bring new needs, which
will require new measures. They will bring also, we
hope, a wider and clearer vision and a mellower wisdom,
as without wisdom even organised power is of little
avail.</p>

<p>In view of the loyalty and devotion of the working
men, it is all the more incumbent on the leaders of the
German Social Democratic party that they should now
guide it along paths which will be wise, practical, and
fruitful. It has too long been their evil fortune or
their own deliberate choice to stand apart from the
main movement of German life. They have had little
part in the work of State, municipality, or country
commune. The party began in opposition to the great
co-operative movement of Germany.
<span class='pageno' title='236' id='Page_236'></span></p>

<p>It is most important that the theories and ideals of
the German Social Democratic party should be fairly
tested and corrected by their application to the practical
work of society. The leaders of the party agree in
their preference for legal and peaceful methods. In
this point they and the representatives of the existing
order might find common ground which may form a
basis for better relations in the future.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br/><br/>ANARCHISM</h2>

<p>It is agreed that anarchism as a form of socialism
originated with Proudhon; but the theory owes its
fuller development chiefly to Russian agitators. The
great apostle of the system in its most characteristic
stage was Michael Bakunin.</p>

<p>Bakunin<a id='r1_13'/><a href='#f1_13' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a> belonged to the highest Russian aristocracy
and was born at Torshok, in the government of
Twer, in 1814. In due time he entered the army as
an officer of artillery, which was a select department of
the service. While serving in Poland, however, he was
so painfully impressed with the horrors which he saw
exercised under Russian despotic rule, that he resigned
his commission and entered on a life of study. In
1847 he visited Paris, and met Proudhon, who had a
decisive influence on his opinions.</p>

<p>The revolutionary movement of 1848 gave the
first opportunity for the activity of Bakunin as agitator.
He was particularly concerned in the rising at
<span class='pageno' title='238' id='Page_238'></span>
Dresden in 1849. But the hands of the reactionary
Governments and of their police were heavy on the baffled
enthusiasts of the revolution. Bakunin had a full
share of their bitter experience. As he tells us himself
in his work on Mazzini, he was for nearly eight years
confined in various fortresses of Saxony, Austria, and
Russia, and was then exiled for life to Siberia.
Fortunately, Muravieff, Governor of Siberia, was a
relative, who allowed him considerable freedom and
other indulgences. After four years of exile, Bakunin
effected his escape, and through the greatest hardships
made his way to California, and thence to London in
1860.</p>

<p>Bakunin thus passed in prison and in exile the
dreary years of European reaction which followed the
revolutionary period of 1848. When he returned to
London he found that the forward movement had
again begun. It was a time of promise for his own
country after the accession of Alexander II. to the
throne. In the <span class='it'>Kolokol</span> he assisted Herzen to rouse
his countrymen and prepare them for a new era; but the
impatient temperament of Bakunin could not be satisfied
with the comparatively moderate counsels followed by his
friend. The latter years of his life he spent, chiefly in
Switzerland, as the energetic advocate of international
anarchism. In 1869 he founded the Social Democratic
Alliance, which, however, dissolved in the same year,
and entered the main International. He attempted a
rising at Lyons in September 1870, soon after the fall
of the Second Empire, but with no success whatever.
<span class='pageno' title='239' id='Page_239'></span></p>

<p>At the Hague Congress of the International he was
outvoted and expelled by the Marx party. His activity
in later years was much impaired by ill-health. He died
at Berne in 1876.</p>

<p>In their preface to Bakunin’s work, <span class='it'>God and the State</span>,
his friends Cafiero and Elisée Reclus afford us some
interesting glimpses of the personality of the agitator.
‘Friends and enemies know that the man was great by
his thinking power, his force of will, and his persistent
energy; they know also what lofty disdain he felt for
fortune, rank, glory, and all the miserable prizes which
the majority of men are base enough to covet. A
Russian gentleman belonging to the highest nobility of
the empire, he was one of the first to enter in that
proud association of the revolted, who knew to detach
themselves from the traditions, the prejudices, the
interests of race and class—to contemn their own
happiness. With them he fought the hard battle of
life, aggravated by prison, by exile, by all the dangers,
and all the bitterness which devoted men have to
undergo in their troubled existence.’</p>

<p>They then go on to say how ‘in Russia among the
students, in Germany among the insurgents of Dresden,
in Siberia among his brethren in exile, in America, in
England, in France, in Switzerland, in Italy, among
men of goodwill, his direct influence has been considerable.
The originality of his ideas, his picturesque
and fiery eloquence, his untiring zeal in propaganda,
supported by the natural majesty of his appearance,
and by his strong vitality, gained an entrance for him
<span class='pageno' title='240' id='Page_240'></span>
in all the groups of revolutionary socialists, and his
activity left deep traces even among those who, after
having welcomed it, rejected it because of differences
in aim or method.’ But it was mainly by the voluminous
correspondence with the revolutionary world, in
which he spent whole nights, that his activity was to be
explained. His published writings were the smallest
part of his work. His most important treatise, <span class='it'>God
and the State</span>, was only a fragment. ‘My life itself is
a fragment,’ he said to those who criticised his writings.</p>

<p>Nothing can be clearer or more frank and comprehensive
in its destructiveness than the socialism of
Bakunin. It is revolutionary socialism based on
materialism, and aiming at the destruction of external
authority by every available means. He rejects all the
ideal systems in every name and shape, from the idea
of God downwards; and he rejects every form of
external authority, whether emanating from the will of
a Sovereign or from universal suffrage. ‘The liberty of
man,’ he says in his <span class='it'>Dieu et l’Etat</span>, ‘consists solely in
this, that he obey the laws of Nature, because he has
himself recognised them as such, and not because they
have been imposed upon him externally by any foreign
will whatsoever, human or divine, collective or individual.’
In this way will the whole problem of freedom
be solved: that natural laws be ascertained by scientific
discovery, and the knowledge of them be universally
diffused among the masses. Natural laws being thus
recognised by every man for himself, he cannot but
obey them, for they are the laws also of his own nature;
<span class='pageno' title='241' id='Page_241'></span>
and the need for political organisation, administration,
and legislation will at once disappear.</p>

<p>It follows that he will not admit of any privileged
position or class, for ‘it is the peculiarity of privilege
and of every privileged position to kill the intellect
and heart of man. The privileged man, whether he be
privileged politically or economically, is a man depraved
in intellect and heart.’ ‘In a word, we object to all
legislation, all authority, and all influence, privileged,
patented, official and legal, even when it has proceeded
from universal suffrage, convinced that it must always
turn to the profit of a dominating and exploiting
minority, against the interests of the immense majority
enslaved.’</p>

<p>The following extracts taken from the programme of
the International Social Democratic Alliance, which he
founded, will help to complete our knowledge of the
views of this extraordinary agitator. The Alliance
declares itself atheistic; it seeks the abolition of all
religions, the displacement of faith by science and of
divine justice by human justice, the abolition of
marriage as a political, religious, legal, and <span class='it'>bourgeois</span>
institution. The Alliance demands above all things the
definite and complete abolition of classes, and political,
economic, and social equality of individuals and sexes,
and abolition of inheritance, so that in the future every
man may enjoy a like share in the produce of labour;
that land and soil, instruments of labour, and all other
capital, becoming the common property of the whole
society, may be used only by the workers—that is, by
<span class='pageno' title='242' id='Page_242'></span>
associations of cultivators and industrialists. It looks
forward to the final solution of the social question
through the universal and international solidarity of the
workers of all countries, and condemns every policy
grounded on so-called patriotism and national jealousy.
It demands the universal federation of all local associations
through the principle of freedom.</p>

<p>Bakunin’s methods of realising his revolutionary
programme are suited to his principles. He would
make all haste to sweep away the political and social
institutions that prevent the realisation of his plans for
the future. The spirit of destruction reaches its climax
in the Revolutionary Catechism, which has been
attributed to Bakunin, but which contains extreme
statements that do not consist with his acknowledged
writings. It is at least a product of the school of
Bakunin, and as such is worthy of attention. The
spirit of revolution could not further go than it does in
this document. The revolutionist, as the Catechism
would recommend him to be, is a consecrated man, who
will allow no private interests or feelings, and no
scruples of religion, patriotism, or morality, to turn
him aside from his mission, the aim of which is by all
available means to overturn the existing society. His
work is merciless and universal destruction. The
future organisation will doubtless proceed out of the
movement and life of the people, but it is the concern
of coming generations. In the meantime all that
Bakunin enables us to see as promise of future reconstruction
is the free federation of free associations—associations
<span class='pageno' title='243' id='Page_243'></span>
of which we find the type in the Russian
commune.</p>

<p>The influence of Bakunin was felt chiefly on the
socialist movement in Southern Europe. The important
risings in Spain in 1873 were due to his
activity. In the later revolutionary movement of Italy
his influence superseded that of Mazzini, for there, as
elsewhere, the purely political interest had yielded to
the social in the minds of the most advanced.</p>

<p>The doctrines of Bakunin have also left their mark
on the recent social history of France and French
Switzerland. About 1879 the anarchist propaganda
showed signs of activity in Lyons and the surrounding
industrial centres. Some disturbances among
the miners at Montceau-les-Mines in 1882, also provoked
the attention of the police and Government,
with the result that sixty-six persons were accused of
belonging to an international association with anarchist
principles. Of the accused the most notable was Prince
Kropotkine, who, with the eminent French geographer
Elisée Reclus and the Russian Lavroff, may be regarded
as the greatest recent exponents of anarchism.</p>

<p>There is no more interesting figure in the recent
revolutionary history of Europe than Prince Kropotkine.
Like Bakunin, he belongs by birth to the
highest aristocracy of Russia; his family, it was sometimes
said among his familiar friends, had a better right
to the throne of that country than the present dynasty.
A man of science of European fame, of kindly nature
and courteous manners, it may seem strange that he
<span class='pageno' title='244' id='Page_244'></span>
should be an avowed champion of the most destructive
creed now extant. A few of the leading facts of his
life, as he gave them in his defence at the trial at Lyons
in 1883, may throw some light on that question.<a id='r2_13'/><a href='#f2_13' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>His father was an owner of serfs, and from his childhood
he had been witness to scenes like those narrated
by the American novelist in <span class='it'>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</span>. The
sight of the cruelties suffered by the oppressed class
had taught him to love them. At sixteen he entered
the school of pages at the Imperial Court, and if he
had learned in the cabin to love the people, he
learned at the Court to detest the great. In the army
and the administration he saw the hopelessness of
expecting reforms from the reactionary Russian Government.
For some time afterwards he had devoted
himself to scientific work. When the social movement
began, Kropotkine joined it. The demands made by
the new party for more liberty met with a simple
response from the Government: they were thrown into
prison, where their treatment was terrible. In the
prison where the Prince was detained nine lost their
reason and eleven committed suicide. He fell seriously
ill, and was carried to the hospital, from which he made
his escape. In Switzerland, where he found refuge,
he witnessed the sufferings of the people caused by the
crisis in the watch manufacture; everywhere the like
miseries, due to the like social and political evils.
Was it surprising that he should seek to remedy them
by the transformation of society?</p>

<p><span class='pageno' title='245' id='Page_245'></span></p>

<p>The record<a id='r3_13'/><a href='#f3_13' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a> of the great anarchist trial at Lyons
in 1883, to which we have already referred, is an
historical document of the first importance. Every
one who wishes to understand the causes, motives, and
aims of the anarchist movement should study it carefully.
At the trial a declaration of opinion was signed
by the accused. The following extracts which give the
purport of this declaration may be useful in elucidating
the anarchist position. What they aim at is the most
absolute freedom, the most complete satisfaction of
human wants, without other limit than the impossibilities
of Nature and the wants of their neighbours,
equally worthy of respect. They object to all authority
and all government on principle, and in all human
relations would, in place of legal and administrative
control, substitute free contract, perpetually subject to
revision and cancelment. But, as no freedom is
possible in a society where capital is monopolised by
a diminishing minority, they believe that capital, the
common inheritance of humanity, since it is the fruit
of the co-operation of past and present generations,
ought to be at the disposal of all, so that no man be
excluded from it, and no man seize part of it to the
detriment of the rest. In a word, they wish equality,
equality of fact, as corollary, or rather as primordial
condition of freedom. From each one according to his
faculties; to each one according to his needs. They
demand bread for all, science for all, work for all; for
all, too, independence and justice.</p>

<p><span class='pageno' title='246' id='Page_246'></span></p>

<p>As one of the accused maintained, even a Government
based on universal suffrage gives them no scope
for effective action in the deliverance of the poor, as of
the eight million electors of France only some half a
million are in a position to give a free vote. In such
a state of affairs, and in view of the continued misery
and degradation of the proletariat, they proclaim the
sacred right of insurrection as the <span class='it'>ultima ratio servorum</span>.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most striking feature of the trial was
the defence of Émile Gautier before the Court of
Appeal. Gautier was described by the Public Prosecutor
as a serious intelligence gone astray, a licentiate
in law who had passed brilliant examinations, a powerful
orator who might be considered as the apostle of the
anarchist idea in France. He was only twenty-nine
years of age. In his defence Gautier described with
passionate eloquence how he, the son of a law-officer
(<span class='it'>huissier</span>), had been converted to revolution and
anarchism by the sight in court of the daily miseries of
debtors and bankrupts and other victims of a capitalist
society. As Voltaire is said to have had an attack of
fever at every anniversary of the massacre of St.
Bartholomew, so he, far away in Brittany, was seized
with a fever of rage and of bitter indignation when the
calendar brought round the accursed dates at which
bills and rents became due.</p>

<p>The leading principles of anarchism are marked by
great clearness and simplicity, and may be summed up
as the rejection of all external authority and of all
<span class='pageno' title='247' id='Page_247'></span>
private appropriation of land and capital. All human
relations will depend on the free action and assent of
the individuals concerned. Free associations will be
formed for industrial and other purposes, and these
associations will with a like freedom enter into federal
and other relations with each other. The process of
social reconstruction is, in short, the free federation
of free associations.</p>

<p>Considered as an historic socialist movement, anarchism
may therefore be set forth under these three heads:
(1) Economically it is collectivism; (2) it is a theory of
revolutionary action, which is certainly its characteristic
feature; (3) it is a theory of the relation of the individual
to law or government.</p>

<p>As regards the first point, its collectivism is common
to it with the prevalent socialism, and therefore need
not detain us here. Nor need much be said in the way
of criticism of the details of the ultra-revolutionary
programme of the anarchists. In our chapter on Marx
we have already indicated that the materialism which
is common to both schools cannot now be regarded
as a tenable or admissible theory of the world. The
materialism of both schools sprang from the Hegelian
left. It should now be considered as dead, and should
in all fairness be set aside in discussion for or against
socialism. With regard to religion and marriage, it is
hardly necessary to state that progress lies not in the
abolition, but in the purification and elevation of those
great factors of human life. Bakunin’s criticism of
religion is simply a tissue of confusion and misconception.
<span class='pageno' title='248' id='Page_248'></span>
Marriage is a fundamental institution, on the
purity and soundness of which social health and social
progress must above all things depend: in this matter,
more than almost any other, society must and should
insist on the maintenance of due safeguards and regulations.
Free love is a specious and delusive theory,
which would tend to bring back social chaos. It would
certainly establish a new slavery of women, whose
needs and rights would be sacrificed in the name of a
hollow and disastrous freedom.</p>

<p>With regard to the third leading principle above
mentioned, the negation of government and external
authority, the anarchy of Bakunin is essentially the
same as that of Proudhon. But in Proudhon the
principle was set forth in paradox, whereas Bakunin
expounds it with perfect frankness and directness, and
with a revolutionary energy which has seldom been
equalled in history. What they both contemplate is a
condition of human enlightenment and self-control in
which the individual shall be a law to himself, and in
which all external authority shall be abolished as a
despotic interference with personal freedom. It is an
ideal to which the highest religion and philosophy look
forward as the goal of man, not as one, however, which
can be forthwith reached through the wholesale destruction
of the present framework of society, but through a
long process of ethical and social improvement. The
error of the anarchists consists in their impatient
insistence on this proclamation of absolute freedom in
the present debased condition of the great mass of the
<span class='pageno' title='249' id='Page_249'></span>
people in every class. They insist on taking the last
step in social development before they have quite taken
the first.</p>

<p>Like its collectivism, the theory of freedom is not a
special feature of anarchism. Collectivism is simply
the economic side of the prevalent socialism generally.
Its theory of freedom is a very old theory, which has
no necessary connection whatever with a revolutionary
programme, and we should not misunderstand it because
of the strange company in which we here find it. It is
a high and long-cherished ideal of the best and greatest
minds. The good man does his duty, not from fear of
the police or the magistrate, but because it is his duty.
And we must regard it as the high-water mark of his
probity and goodness that the right is so wrought into
the texture of his conscience and intelligence that the
doing of it has become as natural to him as breathing
or locomotion.</p>

<p>It is an ideal, also, which we must cherish for society
and for the human race. And not in vain; for there
is an ever-widening circle of human action, in which
good and reasonable men do the right without pressure
or stimulus from without, either from law or government.
We are therefore to regard a well-ordered,
intelligent, and ethical freedom as the goal of the social
development of the human race.</p>

<p>But it is an ideal which must obviously depend for
its realisation on the moral and rational development of
men. It cannot come till men and the times are ripe
for it. No doubt the realisation of it may be hindered
<span class='pageno' title='250' id='Page_250'></span>
by evil institutions and reactionary Governments; yet
these, too, are merely the outcome of such human
nature as was once prevalent in the countries where
we now find them. They have outlived their time.
We are certainly right to get rid of them, as of other
evil habits and conditions of the past, but it is best
done when done wisely and reasonably. And it cannot
be done in any wise or effectual manner except
through a wide organic change in the human beings
concerned.</p>

<p>A moral and rational freedom is therefore the goal
of the social development of the world, and it is a goal
towards which we must strive even now. But it is a
goal that lies far ahead of us. For the present, and in
the future with which we have any practical concern,
society cannot be maintained without adequate laws,
sanctioned and enforced by a regular Government. The
elimination of the baser elements from human character
and human society proceeds with most regrettable
slowness. In the meantime, therefore, we must hold
them in check by the best available methods. We may
improve our laws, our police, and magistrates, but we
cannot do without them.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>It is an interesting fact that socialism has taken its
most aggressive form in that European country whose
civilisation is most recent. The revolutionary opinions
of Russia are not the growth of the soil, and are not the
natural and normal outcome of its own social development:
they have been imported from abroad. Falling
<span class='pageno' title='251' id='Page_251'></span>
on youthful and enthusiastic temperaments which
had not previously been inoculated with the principle
of innovation, the new ideas have broken forth with an
irrepressible and uncompromising vigour which has
astonished the older nations of Europe. Another peculiarity
of the situation is that the Government is an
autocracy served or controlled by a camarilla which has
often been largely foreign both in origin and sympathy.
In this case, then, we have a revolutionary party inspired
by the socialism of Western Europe fighting
against a Government which is also in many ways an
exotic, and is not rooted in the mass of the people.</p>

<p>The history of Russia turns on two great institutions,
the Tzardom and the mir. The Tzardom is the organ
of Russian political life, while the mir is the social
form taken by the agricultural population, and is the
economic basis of the nation generally.</p>

<p>No reasonable man can doubt that the Tzardom has
performed a most important function in the historical
development of Russia. It was the central power which
united the Russian people and led them in the long,
severe, and successful struggle against Tartars, Turks,
Lithuanians, Poles, and Swedes. Without it Russia
would in all probability have suffered the same fate as
Poland, which was distracted, weakened, and finally
ruined by the anarchy and incurable selfishness of its
nobles.</p>

<p>As in other countries, so in Russia, the central power
was established through the subjection of princes and
lords who were crushed by the strong and merciless
<span class='pageno' title='252' id='Page_252'></span>
rule of the Tzars. Among those Tzars, too, were men
of originality and courage like Peter the Great, who
forced the people out of the old-world grooves which
they loved so much; and when other means failed they
did not hesitate to employ the cane, the knout, and the
axe of the executioner to urge their nobles into the
paths of Western progress. We need not say that the
Tzars were not moved by benevolent reasons thus to
benefit their subjects. The historic Tzars were not
philanthropists or humanitarians. The aim of their
reforms was political, to provide the Russian nation
with better means and appliances for the struggle with
her neighbours.</p>

<p>While the nobles were unable to make head against
the Tzardom, the clergy were neither able nor disposed
so to do. In Russia the clergy were not backed by a
great international power like the Papacy. They were
nursed in the traditions of Eastern Greek despotism
and had no inclination to resist their rulers. The
peasants were not a political power, except at the rare
intervals when desperation drove them into rebellion.</p>

<p>Thus the circumstances of Russia have combined to
establish an autocracy which has performed the greatest
historic functions, and which has had a power and
solidity without example in the rest of Europe. It has
maintained the national existence against fierce and
powerful enemies, it has in every generation extended
the borders of the Russian power, and has been a real
centre of the national life, satisfying the needs and
aspirations of the people, not in a perfect manner by
<span class='pageno' title='253' id='Page_253'></span>
any means, yet with a considerable measure of success.
If we do not realise the supreme importance of the
work that the Tzardom has done for Russia, we cannot
understand its present position and the hold it has on
the feelings of the Russian people. The power of the
Tzar has been such that it was hardly an exaggeration,
when the Emperor Paul stated to General Dumouriez
that there was no important man among his subjects
except the person he happened to speak to, and while
he was speaking to him.</p>

<p>It is only another instance of the irony of human
affairs, however, that the really effective limit to the
power of the Tzars is found in the officials, who are
intended to carry it into effect. These officials act as
the organs of the imperial authority from the centre to
the farthest extremities of the empire. Yet they can
by delay, by passive resistance, by suggestion, by falsehood,
by the arts of etiquette and ceremonial, and all
the other methods familiar to the practised servants of
autocracy, mislead or thwart the will of their master
or render it of no effect.</p>

<p>Such is the central power. Let us now consider the
body of the people. In Russia, industry and city life
have not formed a large part of the national existence.
The mass of the people still live directly from the soil,
and are organised in the mir. As is now well known,
the mir is merely the Russian form of the village community,
which at one time prevailed over all the
countries of the world, as they attained to the sedentary
or agricultural stage of development. It was the natural
<span class='pageno' title='254' id='Page_254'></span>
social form assumed by people settling down into agriculture.
It was the social unit as determined by
obvious local economic and historic conditions. In
most countries the village community has been reduced
to a shadow of its former self, partly through the operation
of natural economic causes, but largely also because
the central power and the classes connected therewith
have crushed it out. The local life of England in particular
has been repressed and starved through the
want of the most elementary resources and opportunities.
It has been recognised as a most pressing duty of statesmen
to revive and restore it in accordance with the
prevalent conditions, but it will be long before the
capacity and habit of common action can be again
adequately acquired.</p>

<p>Owing to a variety of causes, which we cannot explain
here, the Russian mir has continued to survive.
It gave to the mass of the Russian people their own
form of social life and of self-government; and it was
economically self-sufficing. The mir drew from the
soil, which it held in common occupation, the means
for its own support and for the support of the nation as
a whole. The relations of the members of the mir to
each other were substantially conducted on terms of
equality and freedom; but in view of the nobles and
the Tzardom they were serfs till their emancipation in
1801. The mir was a social-economic arrangement,
convenient both for the noble proprietors and for the
Tzardom. It afforded to the central Government the
necessary taxes and the necessary recruits; and therefore
<span class='pageno' title='255' id='Page_255'></span>
the Tzars did not disturb it, but rather sought to
fix and solidity it, and thereby make it more efficient as
a source of supply both of soldiers and material means.
Thus for centuries, full of movement in the political
history of Russia, the mir has with little change endured
as the social and economic basis of the national
life.</p>

<p>In Russia, therefore, we find only two institutions
that have had a real vitality and a specific influence,
the Tzardom and the peasant community. Nobles and
priests have exercised a substantive power only when
the Tzardom has suffered a temporary lapse. The
middle class has always been inconsiderable.</p>

<p>It was into a nation thus constituted that the most
advanced revolutionary opinions of Western Europe at
last found their way. The spirit of revolt had indeed
not been unknown in Russia in former times. Among
a peasantry sunk in immemorial ignorance and misery,
and harassed by the incessant tribute of men and taxes
which they were forced to pay, discontent had always
been more or less prevalent, and it had sometimes
broken out in open rebellion. During the reigns of
the great Catharine and of Alexander I. a sentimental
Liberalism had been fashionable in the upper classes.
But it was not a very practical matter, and was not a
serious danger to the autocracy. At the beginning of
his reign Nicholas had to face a rising among the Guards
at St. Petersburg, led by Liberal officers of high birth.
He suppressed it in the speediest and most summary
manner. Till his death, 1855, Nicholas maintained
<span class='pageno' title='256' id='Page_256'></span>
a <span class='it'>régime</span> of repression at home, and was the champion
of absolutism in Europe.</p>

<p>Many circumstances combined to render the accession
of Alexander II. a new departure in Russian
history. The old methods of government had been
thoroughly discredited by the failures of the Crimean
war. There was a general feeling that the ideas and
methods of the West, which had proved their superiority
during the struggle, must be tried in Russia. As the
young Emperor recognised the necessity of a new
policy, great changes were made, and all went well
for a time. Alexander carried the emancipation of
the serfs, instituted new courts of law and a new
system of local government, and gave a real impetus
to education. It was not long, however, before the
Emperor began to hesitate in view of the Liberal
forces which he had let loose, and which threatened
to overturn the whole fabric of Russian society. Like
his uncle, Alexander I., the young monarch had not
resolution enough to persevere in a practical and
systematic course of reform.</p>

<p>The changes already made, and the prospect of
changes still to come, roused into action all the conservative
instincts and prejudices of old Russia. The
insurrection of Poland in 1863, which called forth the
sympathies of many Russian Liberals, provoked also a
powerful reaction in old Russian circles. An attempt
by Karakozoff on the Emperor’s life in 1866 may be
regarded as the turning-point of his reign. Ideas of
steady reform and of gradual temperate change have
<span class='pageno' title='257' id='Page_257'></span>
not yet become familiar to the Russian temperament.
Between those who wished to reform everything, and
those who wished no change at all or to change very
slowly, no compromise was possible in the circumstances
and conditions of Russian society. Thus a
revolutionary movement soon declared itself in full
opposition to the policy of the Tzar. When we consider
that the new party menaced not only the special
political institutions of Russia, but the fundamental
principles of the existing society generally—property,
religion, and the family—we can see that the breach
was inevitable.<a id='r4_13'/><a href='#f4_13' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[4]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>Three stages may be recognised in the history of the
revolutionary movement. The first covered the period
from the accession of Alexander II. in 1855 to about
1870. Its leading characteristic was negation, and the
name of Nihilism, which is often erroneously applied to
the whole revolutionary movement, should properly be
restricted to this early stage. In the main it was
simply the spirit of the Hegelian left frankly accepting
the materialism of Büchner and Moleschott as the
final deliverance of philosophy. In a country where
religion had little influence among the educated classes,
and where philosophy was not a slow and gradual
growth of the native mind, but a fashion imported from
abroad, the most destructive materialism made, an easy
conquest. It was the newest fashion; it was the
<span class='pageno' title='258' id='Page_258'></span>
prevalent form among those who were reckoned the
most advanced thinkers; it was clear, simple, and
thorough. It was particularly well suited to a state of
culture which was superficial, without experience or
discipline.</p>

<p>In the words of Turgenief, who has portrayed the
movement in his novel, <span class='it'>Fathers and Sons</span>, the Nihilists
were men who ‘bowed before no authority of any kind,
and accepted on faith no principle, whatever veneration
may surround it.’ They weighed political institutions
and social forms, religion and the family, in the balances
of that negative criticism, which was their prevailing
characteristic, and they found them all wanting. With
revolutionary impatience they rejected everything that
had come down from the past, good and bad alike.
They had no respect for art or poetry, sentiment or
romance. A new fact added to our positive knowledge
by the dissecting of a frog was more important than
the poetry of Goethe or a painting by Raphael.</p>

<p>Nihilism as represented by Bazarof, in the novel of
Turgenief, is certainly not an attractive picture. We
may respect his courage, honesty, thoroughness, and
independence; but his roughness, cynicism, and indifference
to family feelings are very repellent. Through
the early death of the hero we are prevented from observing
what might have been the further development
of his character. We feel sure that if the story of this
typical life had been continued, we should have seen
very considerable changes in a more positive direction.
The mood of universal negation can only be a temporary
<span class='pageno' title='259' id='Page_259'></span>
phase in individual or national development.
Negation may be the physic, it cannot be the diet, of
the mind.</p>

<p>No movement for emancipation can be a purely
negative thing; and no movement can be adequately
described by reference to a single characteristic. The
Nihilists found a wider view of the world in the
writings of Darwin, Herbert Spencer and J. S. Mill;
and they had also at an early period felt the influence
of Saint-Simon, Fourier, Robert Owen, and latterly also
of Lassalle and Marx. From the first, Nihilism seems
to have involved a broad and real sympathy with the
suffering classes. They wished to recall the attention
of men from windy verbiage about art and poetry, from
a sentimentalism which was often spurious, and from
the clatter of the parliamentary machine, whose grinding
was solely for the benefit of the wealthier classes,
to the question of ‘daily bread for all,’ to the common
people perishing for lack of elementary knowledge. And
they insisted strongly on the equal rights of women.</p>

<p>It is evident that Nihilism could only be a passing
phase in the history of Russia, and that it had a wholesome
and beneficial side as well as a repellent one. In
a country which was oppressed by an enormous burden
of immemorial prejudices and abuses, a powerful dose
of negation was calculated to have a most salutary
operation. But the movement could not long live on
negations merely. As time went on, the struggle for
emancipation in Russia began to assume a more positive
character.
<span class='pageno' title='260' id='Page_260'></span></p>

<p>In this way the revolutionary movement entered on
its second stage, the stage of socialistic teaching and
propaganda. Events in the West had kindled the
imagination of the youthful champions of liberty in
Russia, the rise and progress of the International, the
terrible struggle at Paris under the Commune, the
growth of the German Social Democracy. A positive
and far-reaching ideal now drew the aspirations of the
enthusiasts for liberty, the deliverance of the proletariat,
represented in Russia by an ignorant and wretched
peasantry. The anarchic socialism of Bakunin was
unquestionably the controlling element in the new
Russian movement. Beside it we must place the influence
of Lavroff, another eminent Russian exile, who
represented the more temperate phase of anarchism,
shading off into the recognition of a constitutional and
gradual development of the theory. In its second stage
also the revolutionary movement of Russia was a mixed
phenomenon. The anarchism of Bakunin continued,
however, to be the characteristic feature, and thus the
negative factor was still prominent enough.</p>

<p>From Bakunin also proceeded the practical watchword
at this stage of the revolutionary movement, ‘to
go among the people’ and spread the new doctrines.
And this course was unwittingly furthered by the
action of the Government. Early in the <span class='it'>seventies</span>,
hundreds of young Russians of both sexes were studying
in Western Europe, particularly at Zürich in
Switzerland. As their stay there exposed them to
constant contact with revolutionary Russian exiles, and
<span class='pageno' title='261' id='Page_261'></span>
to infection with all the unsettling ideas of the West,
an imperial ukase of 1873 recalled them home. They
returned home, but they carried their new ideas with
them. ‘Going among the people’ was adopted as a
systematic principle, a passion and a fashion among the
youthful adherents of anarchism. In accordance with
their creed they had no appointed organisation, no very
definite plan of action. They ‘went among the people’
as the apostles of a new theory, each one as his heart
moved him.</p>

<p>They went to be teachers or midwives or medical
helps in the villages. In order the better to identify
themselves with the common folks, some learned the
humblest occupations. The trades of carpenter or shoemaker
were most usually chosen, as being the easiest to
master. Others toiled for fifteen hours a day in the
factories, that they might have an opportunity of saying
a word in season to their fellow-workers. Ladies
and gentlemen, connected with the aristocracy and
nurtured in all the refinement of civilisation, patiently
endured the nameless trials of living with the Russian
peasant. They endeavoured to adopt the rough hands
and swarthy weather-beaten complexion, as well as the
dress of the peasant, that they might not excite his distrust,
for the gulf between the lower classes and the
gentlemen in Russia is wide and fixed. The peasants
had experience of the gentleman only as the representative
of the Government coming with the knout and the
police to extort taxes and recruits. No wonder that
the sight of a shirt underneath the sheepskin of the
<span class='pageno' title='262' id='Page_262'></span>
socialist missionary was enough to arouse the unconquerable
suspicion of the poor people of the country.</p>

<p>The success of the missionaries was limited. With
all his strong suspicion and his narrow range of ideas,
the peasant could not easily understand the meaning
and purpose of those strange men teaching strange
things. The traditions of the past, as they came down
to him dim and confused, contained many a bitter
memory of disappointed hopes. He was apathetic as
well as suspicious. Moreover, the teacher often delivered
his message in half-digested formulas which had
a meaning only as connected with the economic development
of Western Europe, and which did not rightly
attach themselves to anything within the experience of
the Russian Peasantry.</p>

<p>Above all, the propaganda enjoyed only a very brief
period of activity. The teachers went about their work
with very little circumspection, in the careless free-and-easy
way which seems so natural to the Russian temperament.
Consequently, the Government had no
difficulty in discovering and following up the traces of
the propagandists. Before the year 1876 had ended,
nearly all of them were in prison. More than 2000
were arrested during the period 1873-76! Many
were detained in prison for years, till the investigations
of the police resulted in 50 being brought to trial at
Moscow and 193 at St. Petersburg at the end of 1877.
Most were acquitted by the courts, yet the Government
sent them into exile by administrative process.</p>

<p>The adverse experiences which we have recorded
<span class='pageno' title='263' id='Page_263'></span>
brought the attempts at peaceful propaganda to a close,
and the revolutionary party decided on the propaganda
of action. They resolved to settle among the people
and prepare them for a rising against the Government.
Where peaceful teaching had failed, they sought to
force a way by violent methods. It was a desperate
policy to pursue among a people who had not been
able even to understand the aims of the revolutionary
party.</p>

<p>It is very characteristic of the circumstances of
Russia that the most successful attempt at thus organising
a scheme for revolutionary action could gain the
adhesion of the peasantry only by pretending that it
had the sanction of the Tzar. Jacob Stephanovitz, one
of the prominent members of the revolutionary party,
gave it out in South-Western Russia that he had an
order from the Tzar to form a secret society among the
common people against the nobles, priests and officials
who were opposing the imperial wishes to confer land
and freedom on the peasants. Those to whom he addressed
himself could hardly believe that the Emperor
was so powerless, but he did eventually succeed in
forming a society of about a thousand members. When
the plot was discovered by the police, the peasants were
naturally enraged at the deception which had been
practised on them. It should be added that such a
method of action did not meet with the approval of the
party as a whole.</p>

<p>Like the peaceful propaganda, the propaganda of
action failed to gain a firm footing among the people.
<span class='pageno' title='264' id='Page_264'></span></p>

<p>At every step the revolutionary party found the organs
of the central power ready to suppress their efforts in
the most summary way. They were now convinced
that they must directly attack the autocracy and its
servants, and as they had received no mercy they
decided to show none; and thus began the resolute,
systematic, and merciless struggle of the revolutionary
party against the Tzardom. For this end they naturally
made a great change in their mode of action. They
adopted a strong organisation instead of the lax discipline
or total want of discipline commended by Bakunin.
Affairs were conducted by a secret central committee,
who with unsparing energy carried out the new aims
of the party. The first great act in this the third stage
of the Russian revolutionary movement was the assassination
of General Trepoff, Prefect of Police, by Vera
Sassoulitsch, at St. Petersburg, in 1878. The occasion
of the deed was the flogging, by command of Trepoff, of
a political prisoner personally unknown to her. Her
object was to avenge the cause of outraged humanity on
the servant of the autocracy. At the trial she was
acquitted by the jury, to the great surprise of the
Imperial Court. An attempt by the police to apprehend
her on leaving the place of trial was frustrated by the
mob, and she succeeded in making her escape to
Switzerland.</p>

<p>The public gave the most unmistakable proofs of
sympathy with Vera Sassoulitsch; and the event naturally
excited great enthusiasm and emulation among the
eager spirits of the revolutionary party. Police officials
<span class='pageno' title='265' id='Page_265'></span>
and spies of the Government were cut off without mercy.
General Mezentseff, Chief of Police, was stabbed in the
streets of the capital in broad daylight. Prince
Kropotkin, Governor of Charkoff, a relative of the
revolutionist, was shot. General Drenteln was also
openly attacked in the streets. After thus assailing
the officers of the executive, they proceeded systematically
to plan the assassination of the Tzar himself, as
the head of the central power which they abhorred so
much. Solovieff fired five shots at the Tzar without
doing any harm; three attempts were made to wreck
the imperial train, one of them failing because the
Tzar had made a change in his arrangements; and he
escaped the terrible explosion at the Winter Palace
only because he was later than usual in entering his
dining-room. These failures did not prevent the executive
committee from prosecuting its desperate work,
and on March 13, 1881, followed the tragic death of
Alexander II.</p>

<p>We need not say that the violent death of Alexander
II. sent a thrill of horror throughout Europe. It was
felt to be a most lamentable and regrettable ending to
a reign which had begun with such high and generous
aspirations, and with so much promise of good to the
Russian people. There was a natural difficulty in
understanding how a Sovereign, benevolent in character
and not unwilling to pursue a liberal policy, should be
the victim of a forward movement among his people.
The explanation must be found in the special circumstances
of Russia, for Alexander was merely the representative
<span class='pageno' title='266' id='Page_266'></span>
of a political system which, by its historic
evolution, its nature and position, has exercised an
absolute and often merciless mastery over its subjects,
and the men that cut him off were youthful enthusiasts,
who with revolutionary impatience were eager to apply
to the belated circumstances of Russia the most extreme
theories of the West.</p>

<p>The historian has often to regret that more wisdom
is not available for the management of human affairs,
and we may believe that a moderate measure of wisdom
and patience might have prevented the fatal collision
between the Tzar and the revolutionary party. The
Tzardom, as we have seen, has performed a great and
indispensable function in the national life of Russia. It
still seems to be the only practicable form of government
in such a country. No class is advanced or
powerful enough to take its place. The mass of the
Russian people are not yet capable of self-government
on a wide scale. There is no large educated class. The
middle and industrial class, in the modern sense of the
word, are still comparatively small and unimportant;
and it is probable enough that if there had been an
influential middle class, and if the abolition of serfdom
had been effected under their auspices, the peasants
would have received less favourable treatment than
they experienced from the autocracy. The best available
form of government for Russia seems to be an
enlightened Tzardom, and the Emperor Alexander II.
was personally both enlightened and well-intentioned.</p>

<p>At the same time the position of the Tzardom cannot
<span class='pageno' title='267' id='Page_267'></span>
very long be tenable in its present form. Russia lies
where it is, in close proximity to progressive countries.
In the past the Russian people have been largely
disciplined by Germans; they have learned much from
England, and have perhaps shown the greatest social
and spiritual affinity to the French. This intercourse
will go on. The strongest and most watchful Tzar
cannot maintain a Chinese wall of separation between
his country and the rest of Europe. Nor can the Tzars
expect to have the benefit of the science of Western
Europe for military purposes, and at the same time
succeed in shutting it out from influencing the social
and political life of their people. It is inevitable,
therefore, that the liberal ideas of the West will continue
to dissolve and disintegrate the old fabric of
Russian ideas and institutions. One of two results
appears necessary, either that the Tzars must strenuously
follow the path of reasonable and energetic reform,
or they may risk a revolution which will sweep
away the present central power.</p>

<p>For Russia, as for other countries, there are but two
alternatives, progress or revolution. If the latter consummation
were to happen, it does not, however, follow
that the cause of freedom would have any great direct
and immediate furtherance. In the circumstances of
Russia the man who wields the military power must be
supreme. A new ruler resting on the army might be
not less an autocrat than the old. We can but say
that the present policy of the Tzardom is seriously retarding
and arresting the natural and national development
<span class='pageno' title='268' id='Page_268'></span>
of Russia, and that it tends to provoke a catastrophe
which may endanger its own existence. The
industrial progress now being made in the country
renders it only the more necessary that her political
institutions should make a corresponding advance.</p>

<p>It remains now to say a word about the revolutionists
who have played so remarkable a part in the recent
history of Russia. The members of the Russian revolutionary
party have been drawn from nearly all classes
of the people. Some, as we have seen, belonged to highly
placed aristocratic families; some have been sons of
priests and of the lower officials. More recently the
rural classes supplied active adherents to the militant
party. One of the most notable features of the movement
is the influence exerted in it by women. It was
Vera Sassoulitsch who opened the death-struggle with
the autocracy in 1878. A lady of high birth, Sophia
Perovskaia, by the waving of a veil guided the men
who threw the fatal bombs at the assassination of
Alexander II.</p>

<p>But whether aristocrats or peasants, men or women,
the members of the Russian revolutionary party have
been remarkable for their youth. The large majority
of those engaged in the struggle had not attained to the
age of twenty-five. In view of their extreme youth,
therefore, we need not say that they had more enthusiasm
than wisdom, and more of the energy that aims
at immediate success than of the considerate patience
that knows how to wait for the slowly maturing fruits
of the best and surest progress. Having regard to the
<span class='pageno' title='269' id='Page_269'></span>
very subversive theories which they tried to sow broadcast
among the masses of the Russian people, we see
clearly enough that no autocracy in the world could
avoid taking up the challenge to authority which they
so rudely threw down. Only the Government of an
enlightened people long familiar with the free and open
discussion of every variety of opinion, can afford to
give unlimited opportunity of propaganda to such
views as were entertained by the Russian revolutionary
party.</p>

<p>Yet while the theories of the party were from the
first of a most subversive nature, it is right to emphasise
the fact that they did not proceed to violent action
till they were goaded into it by the police and the other
officials of the central Government. Indeed, the measures
of the Government and its representatives have
often directly tended to the stirring up of the revolutionary
mood. By their irritating measures of repression
they provoked, among the students at the universities,
disturbances which they quelled by most brutal methods.
Young men arrested on suspicion, and kept in vile
prisons for years while awaiting investigation, were
naturally driven to hostile reflection on the iniquity of
a Government from which they received such treatment.</p>

<p>In speaking of a country like Russia, we need not
say that the most elementary political rights were
denied the revolutionists. They had no right of public
meeting, no freedom of the press, no freedom of
utterance anywhere. They were surrounded with spies
ready to give to every word and deed the worst interpretation.
<span class='pageno' title='270' id='Page_270'></span>
The peasants whom they desired to instruct
in the new teaching might inform upon them. Their
comrades in propaganda might be induced or coerced to
betray them. It was often fatal even to be suspected, as
the police and the other organs of Government were only
too disposed to take the most rigorous measures against
all who were charged with revolutionary opinion. Nor
could the accused appeal to the law with any confidence,
for the ordinary tribunals might be set aside, and his
fate be decided by administrative procedure; that is,
he could be executed, or condemned to prison or exile
in Siberia, without the pretence of a legal trial. In such
circumstances it was natural that resolute champions
of liberty should be driven to secret conspiracy in
its extremest form, and to violent action of the most
merciless character.</p>

<p>While, therefore, historical accuracy obliges us to
emphasise the fact that the aims of the revolutionary
party far exceeded all that is included in liberalism and
constitutional government, it is only just to explain that
they resorted to violent methods only because the most
elementary political rights were denied them. In the
fiercest mood of their terrible struggle with the autocracy,
they were still ready to throw aside their
weapons.</p>

<p>In the address sent by the Executive Committee to
Alexander III., after the death of his father, in March
1881, they offered to give up their violent mode of
action, and submit unconditionally to a National
Assembly freely elected by the people. They meant
<span class='pageno' title='271' id='Page_271'></span>
under a constitutional government to have recourse
only to constitutional methods.</p>

<p>With regard to the number of those concerned in the
Russian revolutionary movement, it is not easy to speak
with precision. There is no proof that the anarchist
opinions have gained a large body of adherents in the
country. The numerical strength of the party directly
engaged in the struggle with the Tzardom has always
been comparatively small. On the other hand, the
movement has evidently met with a very wide sympathy
in Russian society. In the absence of precise
information, we may quote the words of one who has a
good right to speak for the revolutionary party:—</p>

<p>‘The Russian revolutionary movement is really a revolution
<span class='it'>sui generis</span>, carried on, however, not by the mass
of the people or those feeling the need of it, but by a kind
of delegation, acting on behalf of the mass of the people
with this purpose.</p>

<p>‘No one has ever undertaken, and perhaps no one
could with any certainty undertake, to calculate the
numerical strength of this party—that is to say, of
those who share the convictions and aspirations of
the revolutionists. All that can be said is, that it is
a very large party, and that at the present moment it
numbers hundreds of thousands, perhaps even millions
of men, disseminated everywhere. This mass of people,
which might be called the Revolutionary Nation, does
not, however, take a direct part in the struggle. It
entrusts its interests and its honour, its hatred and its
vengeance, to those who make the revolution their sole
<span class='pageno' title='272' id='Page_272'></span>
and exclusive occupation; for under the conditions
existing in Russia, people cannot remain as ordinary
citizens and devote themselves at the same time to
Socialism and the Revolution.</p>

<p>‘The real revolutionary party, or rather the militant
organisation, is recruited from this class of revolutionary
leaders.’<a id='r5_13'/><a href='#f5_13' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[5]</span></sup></a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br/><br/>THE PURIFIED SOCIALISM</h2>

<p>We have, in the preceding chapters, sketched the rise
and the principles of the leading schools of historic
socialism. The history we have reviewed is a most
protean one, and very prolific in theories which are more
or less akin.</p>

<p>It is easy to trace certain general features of resemblance
in the development of socialism. In the
experiments conducted by the followers of Saint-Simon,
Fourier, and Owen, we see a desire forthwith to create
a ready-made and complete socialism, which almost
always ended in failure. Louis Blanc and Lassalle
agreed in demanding the organisation of society on
democratic principles, and the establishment of productive
associations by a State thus constituted. The
resemblance in type between the community of Owen,
the <span class='it'>phalange</span> of Fourier, and the free commune of
Bakunin is obvious; and it is not going too far to
say that all of them have interesting points of analogy
with the village community, which has its survival in
the Russian mir.</p>

<p>Throughout the history of socialism we naturally also
<span class='pageno' title='274' id='Page_274'></span>
observe the contrast between the tendency which more
or less emphasises State authority and the need of
centralisation, and that other tendency which regards
the local body as cardinal and decisive. As we have
seen, that contrast was perfectly clear in the earliest
French socialism, in the schools of Saint-Simon and
Fourier. While calling on the State to furnish credit
for productive associations, both L. Blanc and Lassalle
strongly insisted that these associations should be
self-governing and self-developing. The centralising
tendency was very marked in Rodbertus. Though it
cannot be maintained that the Marx school insist excessively
on the claims of authority, yet in the conduct
of the International they had a severe struggle with
the anarchist following of Bakunin. It is simply the
old question of authority and order in relation to individual
and local freedom, which always reappears under
the newest conditions, and which cannot be solved on
absolute principles.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding those general features of resemblance,
it would be a serious mistake to identify socialism
with any of its forms, past or present. They are
only passing phases of a movement which will endure.
If socialism has given proof of a persistent vitality, it
has also undergone many transformations, and will in all
probability undergo many more. Our task now is to
inquire into the significance, tendency, and value of
the general movement.</p>

<p>The problem before us is one of historical interpretation
in the widest sense of the word. It is not an
<span class='pageno' title='275' id='Page_275'></span>
academic question which can be settled by the scholarly
comparison of texts and systems.</p>

<p>If the socialistic movement were complete and
finished, it would be merely a subject of sympathetic
analysis and generalisation by the historian. But the
socialistic movement is not complete; it is in process
of making—probably only in its early stage. It is a question,
therefore, which must be treated not only in the
light of history and human nature, but with special
reference to the now prevailing forces—industrial,
political, social, and ethical. For on these will depend
the future course of the movement and its prospects of
success. While socialism has a past, it has also a profound
significance for the present and the future. The
great task for the student is to find out the rational
meaning and purport of socialism, its probable significance
for the present time and the time coming.</p>

<p>For the rational interpretation of socialism we cannot
too often emphasise the fact that it is not an
abstract system, but a thing in movement. It is not
wedded to any stereotyped set of formulas, whether of
Marx or any other, but must be rooted in reality, and,
while moulding facts, it must adapt itself to them.
Above all, we must ever remember that it claims to
represent the aspirations after a better life of the toiling
and suffering millions of the human race.</p>

<p>Even a cursory review of the historic socialism is
enough to show that, while it has been prolific of new
thought in economics, it has been disfigured by every
kind of extravagance. In general, it has been far too
<span class='pageno' title='276' id='Page_276'></span>
artificial, arbitrary, and absolute in its treatment of
social questions. As we have seen, the early theorists
especially were profoundly ignorant of the laws governing
the evolution of society. Many later socialists of
great influence have laid excessive stress on revolution
as the lever of social progress. Few of them have
really appreciated the bearings of the population question
on the great problems of society. Most of them
have been far too absolute in their condemnation of
competition. In fact, their general position consists
far too much in a sweeping condemnation of the present
society, forgetful the while that it is only out of the
present that the future, in which they place their hopes,
can proceed.</p>

<p>The current socialism, too, has very prematurely
shown a tendency to degenerate into a stiff and barren
orthodoxy, which seeks to apply narrow and half-digested
theories, without adapting or even reasonably
understanding them, to circumstances for which they
are not suited. This is particularly apparent in the
attempts to introduce into England and America formulas
and modes of action which have grown up in the
very different atmosphere of the European continent.
It has not sufficiently recognised the fluent and many-sided
variety of modern life, which cannot be embodied
in any formula, however comprehensive and elastic.</p>

<p>Finally, socialistic speculation has in many cases
tended, not to reform and humanise, but to subvert the
family, on the soundness of which social health above
all things depends. It has not understood the solidity
<span class='pageno' title='277' id='Page_277'></span>
and value of the hereditary principle in the development
of society. Socialists have, in short, been far too
ready to attack great institutions, which it must be the
aim of all rational progress, not to subvert, but to reform
and purify.</p>

<p>In the socialistic treatment of other questions, such as
capital, rent and interest, the same defects of arbitrariness
and absoluteness are apparent. But the extravagances
of the historic socialism are so obvious that they
confute themselves, and we shall not dwell on this
aspect of our subject. We must remember that most
historic systems have had to run themselves clear of the
turbid elements with which they were originally mixed.
Socialism, considered both as a movement and as a
system of economic thought, is still in process of development.
Its theories must undergo the rough-hewing
of continual controversy, discussion, and criticism. The
whole movement must pass through the test, the tear
and wear of experience, under the conditions prescribed
by history and the fundamental laws of human
nature, before its ideals can hope to be wedded to fact.
We might add that it will receive the purification of
experience; only, we have to lament that it is the
fate of our ideals to submit also to the degradation of
experience.</p>

<p>A like charge of abstractness may justly be brought
against the two great German economists, Adolf Wagner
and Schäffle, whose writings have so largely promoted
a better comprehension of socialism. Their economic
works are monuments of learning and lucidity, but
<span class='pageno' title='278' id='Page_278'></span>
their exposition and interpretation of the subject are
marked by that excessive love of system which is
usually characteristic of German specialists. They
have brought to the discussion of the historic socialism
the same systematising spirit with which German
economists have treated Adam Smith. The economists
of the Fatherland have reduced the teaching of Adam
Smith to a set of abstract propositions, and so have
transformed it beyond recognition. In like manner
Adolf Wagner laboriously sums up socialism in abstract
language, whereas it is above all things a concrete
movement, instinct with change and with human passion.
In his <span class='it'>Bau und Leben des sozialen Körpers</span>
Schäffle’s construction of socialism is an elaborate
attempt to conceive society as transformed and dominated
by a single principle.</p>

<p>Such a point of view can never accord with the
actual development of historic forces. In the past the
great economic eras have been remarkable for the endless
variety of forms which they have assumed. Feudalism
was not a stereotyped system, but took a special form
in each European country, and in each country it
changed from age to age. The competitive system has
never entirely and exclusively dominated any society,
and has been endlessly modified by custom and the traditions
of the past, by national and social interests, and by
moral considerations. Adam Smith, the great expounder
of natural liberty, did not put it forth as an abstract
and exclusive principle, but set it in the light of historic
fact, and reserved a large sphere where private enterprise
<span class='pageno' title='279' id='Page_279'></span>
needed to be supplemented by the action of the
State. We can only say of the competitive system that
it has been normal or prevalent over the most advanced
countries of the world for a considerable time. We
must conceive socialism in the same way as claiming,
when certain historical conditions have been realised,
to be the normal or prevalent type of economic and
social organisation.</p>

<p>In fact, they have had too exclusively in view the
theories of Marx and Rodbertus. In his conception of
socialism Wagner has been chiefly influenced by Rodbertus.
Schäffle, in his <span class='it'>Quintessenz des Socialismus</span>,
appears as the interpreter of the Marx socialism. Even
the less absolute presentation of the socialistic theories
by Lassalle should have been sufficient to bring out the
contrast between socialism in movement and socialism
in the abstract.</p>

<p>This is very nearly equivalent to saying that both
economists have been too much influenced by the Prussian
type of government and theory of the State. With
regard to the two socialists, Rodbertus and Marx, we
are not surprised that the former should be Prussian
throughout in his way of thinking, but it is a notable
instance of the irony of circumstances that Marx should
be so largely controlled by habits of speculation which
he had learned in Germany in his youth. He was to
a great degree Prussian and Hegelian in his political
and philosophical habit of mind till the end of his life.
It is natural enough that the conception of socialism
formed by Wagner and Schäffle should be of a similar
<span class='pageno' title='280' id='Page_280'></span>
character. For them socialism is a system of centralisation,
of management from above (<span class='it'>von oben herab</span>)
under a bureaucracy. Such a view may suit people
that are used to a centralising autocracy and bureaucracy
associated with militarism, but it is entirely
opposed to English ideas. An industrial and economic
system which would remind us at every step of the
Prussian army, the Prussian police and Prussian officialism,
is not attractive to those who have breathed a freer
air.</p>

<p>Prussia has had a great mission to perform in modern
history. From its geographical position and the circumstances
attendant on its rise and progress, we can
see that it required a powerful army, a strongly centralised
government, and an industrial system entirely
different from <span class='it'>laissez-faire</span>. We must respect the great
vocations of the different historic peoples, among
which Prussia has been one of the first. But that is no
reason for expressing socialism in terms suggested by
the Prussian form of government, or for supposing that
the claim of socialism to control the economic organisation
of the future will depend on its conforming to the
Prussian type of State. It is to be devoutly hoped that
the type of government rendered necessary by the
struggle for existence among the nations on the European
continent will not become universal.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>But we must now consider a question which is
vastly more important than any of the criticisms now
offered. What may be regarded as the solid and
<span class='pageno' title='281' id='Page_281'></span>
permanent contribution to human progress made by
socialism?</p>

<p>There should be no doubt that socialism has largely
contributed to the following results:—</p>

<p><span class='it'>First</span>, It has greatly helped to give prevalence to
the historical conception of Political Economy. The
very conception of socialism has been based on the idea
of social-economic change. Their subject has naturally
led socialists to study the rise, growth, decline, and fall of
economic institutions. And, as we shall see later on,
the influence of Hegel and Darwin has taught them to
merge the idea of historical economics in the wider and
more fundamental conception of evolution. In England
socialists are now the chief promoters of the advance in
economic study from the ordinary standpoint to the
historical, and from the historical to the evolutionary
point of view.</p>

<p><span class='it'>Secondly</span>, Socialism has greatly deepened and widened
the ethical conception of Political Economy. It has,
in season and out of season, taught that the entire
technical and economic mechanism of society should be
made subordinate to human well-being, and that moral
principle should be supreme over the whole field of
industrial and commercial activity. The charge sometimes
brought against socialism, that it appeals only to
the lower appetites and instincts of humanity, is most
unjust. It would be a more reasonable criticism to say
that it inculcates an unselfishness unattainable by any
probable development of human nature.</p>

<p><span class='it'>Thirdly</span>, Socialism has brought the cause of the
<span class='pageno' title='282' id='Page_282'></span>
poor most powerfully before the civilised world. It is
one of the enduring results of socialistic agitation and
discussion that the interests of the suffering members
of the human race, so long ignored and so fearfully
neglected, have become a question of the first magnitude,
the foremost question in all progressive countries. It
is this question which gives a substantial basis and a
real meaning to the great democratic movement, which
it would be the gravest of all errors to regard as a
merely political struggle. The cause of the poor is
likely to be the burning question for generations, lending
to political questions their interest, seriousness, and
unspeakable importance.</p>

<p><span class='it'>Fourthly</span>, Socialism has given us a searching criticism
of the existing social-economic system. It may be
said to have laid its diagnosing finger on all the sores
of society. The only objection that can be rationally
taken is that the diagnosis has been an exaggerated
one. All fair-minded judges will, however, admit that
the socialistic criticism of the existing competitive
system is largely, if not substantially, justified on the
following points:—</p>

<p>1. The position of the working people, who are the
overwhelming majority in every society, is not in harmony
with ethical ideas. It has often and largely
been a position of degradation, demoralisation, and
misery. Normally, it is not consistent with what must
be striven after as a desirable condition for the mass of
humanity, for it is insecure, dependent and to a large
degree servile. The workmen have no reasonable control
<span class='pageno' title='283' id='Page_283'></span>
of their dearest interests; have no guarantee of a
settled home, of daily bread, and of provision for old
age. It is a delusive freedom that has no solid economic
basis.</p>

<p>2. The prevailing competitive system is to a large
degree anarchy, and this is not an accident, but a necessity
of its nature. This anarchy has two great and
baneful modes of expression: strikes, which are a form
of industrial war, carrying misery and insecurity over
large sections of population, and sometimes menacing
the industrial and social life of a whole nation; and the
great crises, which at times have even a more disastrous
influence, spreading like a storm over the entire civilised
world, overthrowing honourable houses of business,
and exposing to hopeless ruin and starvation millions
of honest people who are in no wise responsible for
their fate. And the times of crash are succeeded
by protracted periods of stagnation, which for all
concerned are scarcely better than the crises which
caused it.</p>

<p>3. The phenomena of waste, which are always more
or less a feature of the competitive system, are particularly
manifest during the great industrial and
commercial crises. Not only are the products of
industry intended for consumption wasted in vast
masses, but the productive forces themselves, such as
machinery and shipping, are sacrificed enormously,
whilst great numbers of people are idle and starving.</p>

<p>4. The prevailing system also leads to the large
development of an idle class of the most motley
<span class='pageno' title='284' id='Page_284'></span>
description. Those conversant with the history of
revolutions know how influential an overgrown idle
class has often been in forcing them on.</p>

<p>5. The existing competitive system also necessarily
leads to a vast amount of inferior, inartistic production
in all departments. Cheapness is too conspicuous
a feature of every branch of industry.</p>

<p>6. Our moral standards in every department of the
national life have been lowered and corrupted by the
excessive prevalence of a commercial and mercenary
spirit. No rank, profession, or calling has escaped its
influence.</p>

<p>7. Thus we are led to the general result, that inequalities
of condition, and the too prevalent anarchy
and insecurity as well as the unworthy status of the
workers under the competitive system, are a permanent
source of trouble and even danger to society. The
circumstances of the workmen have improved; but it
is doubtful whether the improvement has kept pace with
their advancing enlightenment and the growing sense
of their rights and needs. Here again we must emphasise
the fact that the progress of democracy is not
merely a political matter. It means still more the
continual development of intelligence and of higher
and finer needs in the mass of the people, a fuller
consciousness of the claims of labour, a greater capacity
for organisation, a wider moral and intellectual
horizon. In the contrast between their moral and
intellectual growth on the one hand, and their insecure
and inferior position as precarious wage-labourers on
<span class='pageno' title='285' id='Page_285'></span>
the other, we may at one and the same time discover a
great danger to our present social order and a splendid
guarantee of further progress. Now, as ever, progress
must be, attained through struggle, and perfection
through suffering.</p>

<p>Scarcely any reasonable man therefore will deny that
socialism has done excellent service to mankind in so
strongly emphasising the necessity for further progress.
While it has largely helped to rouse the
working classes out of their apathy, it has also done
much to dispel the comfortable optimism of those
who had succeeded in the competitive struggle for
existence.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>This criticism of society is valuable, but its effect is
mainly negative. We may go on to claim, however,
that socialism, when purified from materialism, from the
too revolutionary, absolute, and abstract elements with
which it has been associated in history, can render a
positive and substantial service to human improvement
that would be vastly more valuable than any criticism.
It may be maintained that in its main aim and tendency
socialism is perfectly sound and right. For
amidst much error and exaggeration it has brought out
the type of social economic organisation which in the
future should and will prevail.</p>

<p>In previous chapters it has been made abundantly
clear that the characteristic feature of the present
economic order lies in the fact that industry is carried
on by private competing capitalists served by wage-labour.
<span class='pageno' title='286' id='Page_286'></span>
According to socialism the industry of the
future should be carried on by free associated workers
rationally utilising a united capital with a view to an
equitable system of distribution. As we have already
had occasion to say, no formal statement can rightly
give expression to the meaning of a great historical
movement. But in such language we believe the contrast
between the old order and the new can be most
simply and at the same time with due adequacy expressed.</p>

<p>The same type of industrial organisation has been
well set forth by J. S. Mill in these words: “The form
of association, however, which, if mankind continue to
improve, must be expected in the end to predominate,
is not that which can exist between a capitalist as chief
and workpeople without a voice in the management,
but the association of the labourers themselves on terms
of equality, collectively owning the capital with which
they carry on their operations, and working under
managers elected and removable by themselves.”<a id='r1_14'/><a href='#f1_14' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a> Mill’s
view of the subject, it may be remarked in passing, was
derived from the study of French and English socialists.
His good sense saved him from the utopian extravagance
of these writers, and as he had little sympathy
with the peculiarly German ways of thought, he shows
no tendency to the abstractness of the specialists of the
Fatherland. The result is a conception of socialism
which is at once intrinsically more reasonable, more
adapted to the English mind and to universality, than
<span class='pageno' title='287' id='Page_287'></span>
any other offered by prominent economists. And in
this connection we need hardly add that by the English
mind we mean the mind of the English-speaking
people; also, notwithstanding all that may be said to
the contrary, that the English type of society has the
best claim to universality, because it has best succeeded
in reconciling and realising the fundamental requirements
of order and freedom.</p>

<p>The simple expression of the socialistic theory will,
no doubt, in the course of propaganda and discussion,
long continue to be overlaid and obscured by a mass of
detail, sometimes utopian, sometimes all too abstract
and systematic. It will be well, therefore, to keep the
simplicity of the type in view, but a few explanations
may be necessary more fully to elucidate it.</p>

<p>The true meaning of socialism, when rationally understood,
is given in the dominating tendencies of social
evolution. On the one hand, the effect of the industrial
revolution has been to concentrate the means both
of production and distribution in immense masses.
Capital can now be moved and controlled only on a
large scale. The day for the small capital, and the
successful control of it by individuals, has passed away.
It may continue under exceptional circumstances, but
it can no longer expect to be the normal or prevalent
form of industry. On the other hand, the body of the
people, represented by the modern democracy, can
legitimately claim that they shall no longer be excluded
from the control of their own economic and
social interests. It is a rational and equitable demand
<span class='pageno' title='288' id='Page_288'></span>
that the prevalent divorce of the workers from land
and capital should cease. This divorce can be terminated,
and the mass of the people can be restored to a
participation in the ownership and control of land and
capital, only through the principle of association. This
is the basis of socialism as given in the normal and
dominant forces of the social evolution of our time.
As we said in the introduction, socialism is the child
of two great revolutions—the industrial revolution, and
the vast social and political change embodied in the
modern democracy.</p>

<p>Socialism, rationally interpreted, is therefore simply
a movement for uniting labour and capital through the
principle of association. It seeks to combine labour
and capital in the same industrial and social groups.
In such a group the present distinction between
labourers and capitalists would cease, and the workers
become producers, equitably disposing of the entire
produce.</p>

<p>Such an industrial association would be self-governing.
Socialism is an attempt to establish a free self-governing
type of industry, and would therefore seek
to realise in the social-economic sphere the principles
already recognised in the political. It is a free self-governing
form of industry, corresponding in the
economic sphere to the democratic system in politics;
industry of the people, by the people, for the people.
But while a rational socialism seeks to establish industrial
freedom, it aims also at promoting and securing
industrial peace by terminating the struggle between
<span class='pageno' title='289' id='Page_289'></span>
labour and capital, for, as we have seen, its aim is to
unite them in the same group.</p>

<p>Under such a system the workers will have full
control of their economic interests. They will have the
sobering and steadying discipline of responsibility.
They will no doubt make mistakes, as all bodies of
men have done since the beginning of the world; but
as they will suffer by them, so they will have the
power of correcting them. It will be a self-reforming
and self-developing system of industry.</p>

<p>And it is hardly necessary to state that these
associations will subsist in organic relation to one
another. The State is, in idea or principle, such an
association on the wide scale, just as the municipality
or commune is the local form of association; and their
relations to each other may in various degrees and forms
represent the principle of federalism or centralisation.</p>

<p>In the history and condition of the working people
it is a pathetic fact that their sons, who have been
gifted with exceptional capacity, generally go over to
the richer classes. Their services are thus lost to the
class from which they sprang. It must be the aim of
the socialist movement also to terminate this incessant
divorce between labour and intelligence, by providing
within the groups of associated workers due scope for
the best talent.</p>

<p>Socialism claims to be the normal and prevalent
type of organisation in the future. The methods of
production, distribution, and exchange will be under
social control. This being so, it may surely be regarded
<span class='pageno' title='290' id='Page_290'></span>
as a special instance of the arbitrariness and
absoluteness of the current socialism, when it maintains
that all capital must pass out of individual ownership.
It may safely be maintained that such a condition
of things is not possible, and that, if it were
possible, it is entirely undesirable, because most likely
to repress individual freedom, and affording indefinite
scope for social tyranny. Under any conceivable system
of society the free development of man is likely to be
promoted by the possession of reasonable private means.
The only objection that can be rationally alleged
against private property is when it involves injustice to
others—a possibility which, under socialism, is amply
provided against by the prevalence of social control
over economic processes.</p>

<p>The views just stated are not unwarranted by the
historic socialism. Amidst much that is most extravagant,
Fourier has the merit at least of offering
the strongest safeguards for individual and local freedom.
Fourier provided that every worker should have
the opportunity of gaining and maintaining a capital of
his own, but under such social regulation that it would
no longer involve wrong to others; and further, he
arranged that the owner should have perfect freedom
to transfer his services and his capital from one association
to another. These are features of Fourier’s
system which have been too much neglected by scientific
socialists so called; and in these respects he is
much less utopian than his critics.</p>

<p>In no question is the arbitrariness of the historic
<span class='pageno' title='291' id='Page_291'></span>
socialism more apparent than in the artificial attempts
made to formulate a just method of distribution or
remuneration. We have in previous chapters indicated
the different methods proposed in the schools of Saint-Simon,
Fourier, and Louis Blanc. Nothing has so
much tended to give a utopian air to socialistic speculation.
Our ideas of justice cannot well be expressed
in a single formula, however comprehensive. It has
been the endeavour more or less of all moralists and
legislators since the origin of human society to elucidate
it and reduce it to some kind of reasonable form,
but with only very imperfect results; and socialists
are not now likely to succeed in a task which is really
impracticable. Progress in the realising of justice can
be attained only through the collective enlightenment
and moral experience of the race; and it will always
fall short of our ideals, for our ideals rise as we
approximate towards a realisation of them, and so ever
leave us behind in the race after perfection.</p>

<p>We need not say, however, that it is an obvious
implicate in every equitable theory of distribution that
remuneration must generally depend on work or desert.
The normal income of the future must be based on
service rendered to society by all able members.
Regard will be had to the needs of the disabled.</p>

<p>It should be emphasised, moreover, that socialism
must assert the supremacy of morality over all the
economic processes—production and exchange as well
as distribution. Production should be rational and
systematic. Above all, distribution should be equitable.
<span class='pageno' title='292' id='Page_292'></span>
In these respects socialism is fundamentally opposed to
the one-sided conception of competition which has been
so prevalent. It seeks to supersede the existing competitive
system of industry by a new order, in which
reason and equity shall prevail.</p>

<p>It should also be clear that socialism supplies the
much-needed complement and corrective of the principle
of natural liberty advocated by Adam Smith. The
principle of natural liberty had a great historical value,
and when rightly understood must always be regarded
as a prime factor in every theory of social progress.
But it can be applied only under obvious limits, prescribed
by reason and morality. The natural liberty
of struggling individuals would, if unchecked, land us
in social chaos. The true freedom of human beings is
a rational and ethical freedom. Such principles ought
to prevail in the commercial relations of nations with
each other, as well as in every other department of our
industrial and social life.</p>

<p>Socialism, then, simply means that the normal social
organisation of the future will and should be an
associated or co-operative one. It means that industry
should be carried on by free associated workers. The
development of socialism will follow the development of
the large industry; and it will rationally, scientifically,
and systematically use the mechanical appliances
evolved during the industrial revolution for the promotion
of a higher life among the masses of the people.</p>

<p>It is a new type of industry and economic organisation
the practicability of which must be decided by the
<span class='pageno' title='293' id='Page_293'></span>
test of experience. It cannot be introduced mechanically.
We cannot force or improvise such a change in
the constitution of society. No revolutionary violence
can avail to carry through a transformation which
runs counter to the fundamental laws of human nature
or the great prevailing tendencies of social evolution.
This will be especially manifest when we consider that
its realisation will above all things depend on the
ethical advance of the mass of the people. Character
cannot be improved by magic; it can be substantially
ameliorated only by an organic change, external circumstances
co-operating with an inward moral spirit.
The present competitive system must therefore be
regarded as holding the field until socialism has given
adequate proof of the practicability of the theory which
it offers.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br/><br/>SOCIALISM AND THE EVOLUTION THEORY</h2>

<p>The idea of evolution has had a great influence in the
history of socialistic speculation. Beginning with
Saint-Simon most socialists have recognised three
stages in the economic development of mankind—slavery,
serfdom, and wage-labour—which last they
believe will be displaced by an era of associated labour
with a collective capital. The idea of development
may indeed be regarded as essential to socialism, inasmuch
as it must contemplate a succession of social-economic
changes in history.</p>

<p>Marx and Lassalle were both trained in the school of
Hegel, and naturally applied to the problems of society
the Hegelian theory of development. The principle
that economic categories are historical categories, so
much emphasised by Lassalle, was by him, as it was by
his fellow-labourers, merged in the wider and more
fundamental conception of evolution, historical economics
thus becoming evolutionary economics.</p>

<p>Some of the later socialists see in the theory of
evolution associated with the name of Darwin a suitable
expression of their ideas of development. Followers
<span class='pageno' title='295' id='Page_295'></span>
of Marx have found special points of attraction in
Darwinism. Darwin himself was, of course, not a
materialist; but many speculators have not unreasonably
recognised in his teachings an affinity with
materialism, which obviously accorded well with the
materialistic conception of history held by Marx. The
struggle of classes, which Marx regards as the key to
history, is, we need not say, also an allied feature.</p>

<p>But the Darwinian conception of development has
to many students suggested the strongest reasons for
doubt and hostility with reference to socialism. How
does the theory of the struggle for existence consist
with the harmony of interests contemplated by socialism?
Is it not utopian of the Marx school to believe
that the struggle of classes, which has hitherto characterised
the course of history, can be brought to a close
by a great revolutionary act?</p>

<p>Competition, that <span class='it'>bête noire</span> of the socialists, is
simply the social-economic form of the struggle for
existence. Is not competition, therefore, the prime
condition of social progress? And is not socialism,
therefore, inconsistent with progress?</p>

<p>Thus we are confronted with the twofold problem,
whether socialism does not deny the cardinal principles
of evolution, and thereby also deny the prime condition
of social progress?</p>

<p>These questions are of considerable complexity.
And their import will be better understood it we consider
them in relation to another question with which
they are intimately connected, and which is even more
<span class='pageno' title='296' id='Page_296'></span>
fundamental—the population question. The Darwinian
theory of evolution rests on the Malthusian theory of
population, and can be fully appreciated only by reference
to it.</p>

<p>In this place we need not discuss the theory of
population as a whole, but merely in so far as it bears
on our present inquiry. The theory of Malthus is so
remarkable for its simplicity that no worthy excuse can
be offered for the misconceptions regarding it which
have been prevalent. The seeds of life, so runs the
theory of Malthus, have been scattered throughout the
world with a profuse and liberal hand. All living
things tend to multiply indefinitely. Animals—even
the least prolific—would, if their increase were not
checked, fill the entire world. But as the means of
subsistence are limited, the struggle for existence inevitably
ensues, which is obviously all the more intense
because so many animals are themselves the means of
subsistence to others.</p>

<p>So with man. If his natural powers of increase
were exercised without check, it is only a question of
time when the globe itself would be too small for the
numbers of human beings, even though equipped with
the most effective means of cultivation. In point of
fact, population has almost always pressed on the available
means of subsistence. The only important exceptions
are found in new countries, when opened up to
colonists who have brought with them the superior
methods of exploitation developed in more advanced
civilisations.
<span class='pageno' title='297' id='Page_297'></span></p>

<p>Thus the history of the human race is largely the
record of a struggle for the means of subsistence caused
by the pressure of population. Not that the population
is necessarily dense. Some of the most thinly
scattered peoples have had the greatest difficulty in
making a living, simply because the available means of
subsistence were exceptionally scanty, as the North
American Indians, and above all in the continent of
Australia before its settlement by Europeans. The
study of human history shows that if the population
was small, it was not owing to any defect in the
natural powers of increase of human beings.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the Malthusian theory rests on
two great facts: (1) on the physiological fact, viz. that
all human beings are capable of indefinite increase;
and (2) on a natural economic fact, that the means of
subsistence are not capable of a corresponding indefinite
increase, the ultimate reason of this being nothing else
than the limited size of the planet on which we live.
The inevitable result is the struggle for existence. The
Darwinian theory of the struggle for existence has
the widest application to human society and human
history.</p>

<p>This struggle has gone on through a great variety of
stages. In the earliest phases of human history it generally
resulted in the extermination of the vanquished,
and was often associated with cannibalism. As society
advanced from the hunting and pastoral into the agricultural
state, the victors saw that it would be their interest
to spare the vanquished that they might enjoy the
<span class='pageno' title='298' id='Page_298'></span>
benefit of their labour as slaves. In this way began
the institution of slavery, on which ancient civilisation
rested. The warlike tribes that overturned the Roman
Empire found that they could more easily and conveniently
utilise the labour of the vanquished under
the various forms of serfdom. In modern times free
workers, destitute of capital, are ready under a system
of competition to perform the labour of society for a
wage that renders them the customary subsistence.</p>

<p>In the earliest stages the struggle was one for bare
existence, not far removed above the lower animals;
but as time went on, it began, as we have seen, to take
a higher form. The main motive power, however, has
always been the self-regarding principle in which the
struggle originated. On the whole it was only a more
rational and enlightened self-interest which dictated
the change from extermination to slavery, from slavery
to serfdom, and from serfdom to the system of competitive
free labour. Idealism, the longing for a better
life, has always had a considerable power in human
affairs, and we hope that its influence will never cease
to grow and prevail. Yet it could not be seriously
maintained that the peoples who instituted slavery,
serfdom, or the competitive system, were in the main
actuated by ideal or high ethical motives. It is our
duty to recognise with thankfulness that the inevitable
progress of society has brought with it a higher life,
even though it be merely due to a more enlightened
self-interest.</p>

<p>Thus, while in its early stages it was a struggle for
<span class='pageno' title='299' id='Page_299'></span>
mere existence, in later times it has become more and
more a struggle for a privileged or superior existence.
The victors in most historic struggles have reserved to
themselves the loftier functions of government, war and
the chase, and the vanquished have been constrained to
provide a subsistence both for their masters and themselves
by means of labour. Life still is a struggle for
the best places in society. And it is a particular
object of struggle not to belong to the class of manual
labour.</p>

<p>The competitive system is the latest form of the
struggle for existence. It is not an accident, but the
outcome of the prevalent historic forces. The time
had come when free labour was found to be more
efficient than servile labour. The feudal system, of
which serfdom was a part, went down before the
strongly centralised State. The competitive system is
the form assumed by the struggle for existence in
societies which were controlled by powerful central
governments; it is industrial freedom under conditions
of legality enforced by strongly constituted governments.
In earlier and less settled states of society the
struggle for existence used to be decided by more
direct and forcible methods. In other days men slew
their rivals; at the present time they undersell them.</p>

<p>And we need not say that the competitive system
has been a process of selection, bringing to the front, as
leaders of industry and also as heads of society, the
fittest men.</p>

<p>The struggle for existence, therefore, has continued
<span class='pageno' title='300' id='Page_300'></span>
through human history, and does still continue. And
we may feel assured that under the pressure of an
ever-increasing population it will continue. The only
question is regarding the form it is likely to take in
the historic conditions which now tend to prevail all
over the world.</p>

<p>For no conclusive solution of the population question
is possible under any system. It has been a fundamental
difficulty since the beginning of human society,
and more than anything else may be regarded as the
key to history. The migrations, wars, and conquests
recorded in history have for the most part had their
origin in want caused by the pressure of population on
the extant means of subsistence. No doubt, ambition,
vanity, suspicion, and restlessness have played a very
considerable part of their own in the military annals of
the race, but not nearly so large a part as is generally
supposed. Historians have not given anything like
adequate attention to the economic factors which have
often so decisively operated in human affairs.</p>

<p>In its most comprehensive form, indeed, the population
question does not concern the immediate future,
for the world is not nearly replenished with human
beings. In all the countries dominated by European
civilisation, wealth has, owing to the vast mechanical
development of the last hundred years, increased much
more rapidly than population. But the question is
one which does already practically concern the more
populous centres over large areas of the world. In
many of the old seats of population, both in Europe
<span class='pageno' title='301' id='Page_301'></span>
and the East, the struggle for existence is intense, and
if not strongly counteracted, must tend to the increase
of egotism, unscrupulousness, and general demoralisation.
This is most observable in cases where a large
population has to face the prospect of a declining
prosperity. If the prosperity of this country were
menaced by a great war, or a great shock to the national
credit, or by both together, or simply by the slow
decline of its industrial and commercial supremacy,
the struggle for existence in our large towns would be
unspeakable.</p>

<p>It is obvious, therefore, that we are not yet done
with the problem of population. It is always a serious
matter in the great centres; it may, under very conceivable
circumstances, be a fearful dilemma at no very
distant date; and as the world becomes more thickly
peopled it will more and more present itself as a
pressing question. We cannot here, however, enter
into a detailed discussion of the problem. It will
probably always be a difficulty, and will call forth a
variety of answers. But, as we have already said, no
satisfactory and conclusive solution can be offered or
expected by any one who understands the conditions
of the problem. The solution must wait on the moral
and social development of mankind. There is certainly
no prospect of the question being materially affected
by any physiological modification of the human constitution.
We can only hope that the present progress
of civilised countries in morality, intelligence, and in
a reasonable standard of living, will continue; that
<span class='pageno' title='302' id='Page_302'></span>
the improvement in material and economic conditions
will go hand in hand with ethical advancement; that
the happiness of mankind will not be wrecked by the
irrational and unrestrained gratification of a single
passion. If the mass of the people remain as they
are, ready to sacrifice their own happiness and that of
posterity to animal instinct, the population question
cannot be solved, and the best hopes of human progress
must be unfulfilled.</p>

<p>For socialism, as we have explained it, it may be
claimed that it gives the strongest guarantees that the
difficulty will receive the best and most rational treatment.
As socialism generally means the supremacy
of reason and morals over the natural forces, so with
reference to the population question it means that
natural appetite should be controlled by nobler and
more rational feelings and principles. Under a socialistic
system every member of the community will be
interested in this as in every other serious question.
The general enlightenment and the social conscience
will most powerfully co-operate with the light and the
conscience of the individual to effect a reasonable and
a beneficent solution, as far as possible.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>But we must now return to the questions with which
we started—the relation of socialism to the struggle
for existence, and to social progress as dependent on
the struggle for existence. As we have seen, the
Darwinian theory of the struggle for existence has the
widest application to human society and human history.
<span class='pageno' title='303' id='Page_303'></span>
But the struggle for existence is not the sole principle
of social progress. Social progress proceeds from the
interaction, the balance and harmony, of many principles.
The general question of social development, in
which that of progress is involved, must be regarded in
the light of the following considerations. Only we
must premise that they are not a contradiction of the
Darwinian theory; they are to be taken as a complement
of it, and a correction of the narrow and one-sided
conception of the theory.</p>

<p>1. The political, social, and ethical development of
mankind is largely a record of the endeavour to place
the struggle for existence under regulation. Progress
chiefly and supremely consists in the growing control
of ethical principle over all the forms of selfishness,
egotism, unscrupulousness, and cruelty called forth by
such struggle. In other words, progress mainly consists
in the growing supremacy of law, order, and morality
over the excess of the self-regarding principle in which
the individual struggle has its root. We do not say
that this exhausts the meaning of the ethical development
of man, but it is a most important aspect of it.</p>

<p>Thus the ethical factor is the decisive one in human
progress, but it has advanced <span class='it'>pari passu</span> with the
general social and political progress. We see it in the
crudest and most elementary forms when man emerged
from the darkness of pre-historic times, and it has
gradually developed into a noble complex of ideals,
informed by a growing knowledge and by widening
sympathies. In short, human progress has been a
<span class='pageno' title='304' id='Page_304'></span>
continual effort towards the realisation of the true, the
beautiful, and the good, in such measure as was attainable
by each succeeding generation of the race.</p>

<p>Not that the struggle for existence is hereby
abolished. The struggle, and the regulation of it too,
are carried forward into a further stage of progress, to
be continued on a higher social and ethical plane. The
human struggle generally is on a higher plane than the
animal one which Darwin describes. It is a struggle
on the plane of an intelligence which never ceases to
develop, amongst beings who pursue social and ethical
aims with growing clearness and energy. If the results
still fall so far below our aims, it is because our intelligence
and means of performance, though enlarging, are
still very imperfect.</p>

<p>What we call natural selection in the animal world
is in human history transformed, elevated, and idealised;
it becomes social selection. We may call it natural, if
we please; only, we must remember the greatly altered
character of the agents concerned in it. While at every
stage we see moral and intellectual growth, we must
particularly remember that the new society for which
socialists strive will consist of associated free beings
acting under the regulation and stimulus of high ethical
and artistic ends and ideals.</p>

<p>Nothing, therefore, can be more narrow and one-sided
than to consider the struggle for existence as the
sole lever of human progress. Such one-sided insistence
on the idea of struggle is to deny the whole ethical
development of the world.
<span class='pageno' title='305' id='Page_305'></span></p>

<p>Socialism professes to continue and promote the
ethical and social development which we have described;
on a higher plane of progress than has hitherto
been reached to place the natural economic powers
operating in human destiny under the regulation of
reason, moral principle, and ideals of beauty; to render
technical and mechanical appliances, and all the
material and economic factors underlying human life,
subservient to the well-being of man in a way hitherto
unattained; and so to achieve the ethical freedom of
man and his rational supremacy over the world. The
competitive system is the latest phase in the struggle
for existence, and socialism is the latest theory for the
regulation of it along the well-approved lines of human
progress.</p>

<p>By such tests, none lower or narrower, must a rational
socialism be tried.</p>

<p>2. There is, however, one side of this ethical progress
which deserves to be more particularly considered. The
ethical progress of man is largely a development of the
principle of sociality, community, or association. This
principle has its centre in the family, with all that is
implied therein; in the association of man and woman,
in the sacrifices made by both and especially by the
mother for the children. Historically, it has developed
from the tribe into ever wider and more complex forms—the
city, nation, and race—until it more and more
embraces the whole human family. That is, it finally
tends to become international, so that the whole human
family may be included in common ethical and social
<span class='pageno' title='306' id='Page_306'></span>
bonds—a state of things which is still far from being
realised, but it is in process.</p>

<p>In the evolution of living things two factors have
been decisive, the development of brain power and the
development of the social principle. We need scarcely
add that the two are intimately connected, and further
that the brain power of man is closely co-ordinated
with his physical development. The supremacy of
man is due to his brain power and to his readiness
to associate for common ends, far more than to his
strength or hardihood, in which he is greatly excelled
by other animals. The entire history of civilisation
bears witness to the potency of the two factors; for
it is a truism to say that the communities and races
that have excelled in brain power and in the family
and social moralities have prevailed. A rational
socialism might be defined as the mastery of associated
human intelligence over the resources of nature for
the general good. In this respect, also, the success of
socialism would simply mark the continuous development
of man along the tested and approved lines of
progress.</p>

<p>It is no doubt one of the many exaggerations of
Lassalle, due partly to his function of agitator, that he
laid excessive emphasis on the principle of community
as the lever of progress, compared with the individual
principle. Progress has always depended on the action
and interaction of both principles. It is rather an idle
question, which of the two is the more important; like
that other question, whether the great man makes the
<span class='pageno' title='307' id='Page_307'></span>
age, or the age makes the great man. The man and
the age make each other.</p>

<p>We know the great influence often exerted in history
by exceptional brain power or character, and both are
often associated with a prominent individual. But
high individual capacity is usually, if not always, found
in an age and community with a high average of talent.
Well-organised and well-endowed societies are most
likely to produce the strongest and finest individuals,
and it is only in such societies that the greatest
individuals are likely to find adequate scope for their
powers. We cannot form a just estimate of our
subject unless we give due weight to both principles,
but obviously the danger to society lies in the excessive
development of the individual principle. History has
too often witnessed the abnormal development of private
selfishness, so overgrown as to weaken and finally
dissolve the society in which it acted, thus accomplishing
its own destruction. This is indeed the open secret
of the ruin of most communities that have existed.
We should seek in vain for an instance of a community
ruined by excessive regard for the public good. A
happy and wholesome individual development can be
secured only by healthy relation and due subordination
to society and the common weal.</p>

<p>It will be seen, then, that the principle of sociality or
of association plays a specially important part in human
development. Yet in close connection with it we again
observe the wide operation of the struggle for existence.
The struggle for existence is not only a struggle of
<span class='pageno' title='308' id='Page_308'></span>
individuals against each other. It has also been a
struggle of tribe against tribe, of city against city, of
nation against nation, and race against race. In the
existing society it is, moreover, a struggle of classes
against each other. Considered in this aspect, which
is too obvious to require illustration, the struggle for
existence has assumed the most complicated forms, and
has had the greatest influence in the history of the
world. And the intensity of the struggle has called
forth some of the highest human qualities—inventiveness,
capacity for organisation, submission to
discipline, enthusiasm, heroism, and self-sacrifice. The
struggle, hateful though it be in many respects, has
been one of the great training schools of the human
race.</p>

<p>Modern European history is an impressive example
of the importance of this struggle for existence. The
progress of Europe is greatly owing to the fact that in
this continent we have a group of communities which
are closely related, yet independent, and rivals. In
every department of activity they learn from each other,
and spur one another on by continual emulation. Each
must follow its rivals in the adoption of every new
improvement, under penalty of decline and even ruin.
Communities like China and India in the old world, and
the native States of Mexico and Peru in the new world,
were isolated, and therefore stationary.</p>

<p>Under the existing conditions, a social organisation
favourable to the development of the intelligence,
energy, and enthusiasm of the mass of the people is
<span class='pageno' title='309' id='Page_309'></span>
more and more necessary to success in the keen and
arduous struggle waged by the European communities.
The future both of democracy and of socialism will
largely depend on how far they can supply these advantages
of organisation. For it is a struggle also between
forms of social organisation. Any better form of
organisation, when adopted by one of the communities,
must also be adopted by its rivals. As soon as it was
recognised that universal education and universal liability
to military duty gave Prussia an exceptional
advantage in the European struggle, other nations
have been eager to follow.</p>

<p>Thus, through the development of the principle of
sociality in the history of civilisation, the struggle for
existence is not abolished. It is continued under more
complex conditions, on a wider scale, over larger areas,
by greater masses of organised men, with mightier
weapons and vaster resources.</p>

<p>3. It is one of the most interesting aspects of
history, that we regard it as the education of the
human race. Social progress is the result of a long
process of discipline, and the training has often been
most severe. It would appear as if mankind needed
to be goaded and driven forward on the path of
improvement.</p>

<p>The theory of the struggle for existence throws new
light on the education of humanity. The nations of
the world have been schoolmasters to each other; and
the competitive system, too, has been a process of discipline
for all who have been concerned in it. Socialism,
<span class='pageno' title='310' id='Page_310'></span>
rightly understood, may be regarded as a new phase of
the discipline of humanity. For the transition into
socialism, if attainable at all, will be more difficult
than many suppose. It must be gradual, preparing the
minds and morals, the habits and institutions, of the
mass of the people for a higher form of social-economic
life. As isolated individuals, the working class have
no prospect of success. They can make progress only
by practising the virtues of combination, foresight,
self-control, self-denial, discernment in choosing their
leaders, loyalty, unwearying perseverance in well-doing.
These qualities have been already cultivated in them
by means of their trade-unions and co-operative
societies. The process of socialistic evolution will
carry on the process of social-economic education.</p>

<p>Socialism must therefore be regarded as providing
an economic and social discipline for all men who have
the requisite insight, and particularly for the working
class, who are its special representatives and promoters.
It will offer fresh scope and opportunity to the working
class as a whole. But it will also be a process of
social selection; for, while inviting all, it will attract
the fittest and most worthy, and lead them on to
higher things.</p>

<p><span class='pageno' title='311' id='Page_311'></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br/><br/>RECENT PROGRESS OF SOCIALISM</h2>

<p>During recent years the organised socialism has made
notable progress in nearly all parts of Europe. The
German working men still continue to form the vanguard
of the proletariat of the world. At the general election
of 1893 the Social Democrats polled 1,786,000 votes,
which was an increase of nearly 360,000 on the large
figures of 1890. At the general election of 1898 the
Social Democratic vote rose to about 2,100,000. Their
seats in the Reichstag increased from 48 to 56, out of a
total of 397.</p>

<p>There is no change to record in the principles of
this powerful party. Its tactics, while remaining
essentially the same, naturally vary to some degree
according to circumstances. It adheres to the Erfurt
programme. Its single-minded aim is the advocacy
and promotion of the interests and ideals of the
working class of Germany without compromise and
without alliance with other parties, though it is ready
to co-operate with them in particular questions. The
party consistently refuses to vote for the imperial
budgets, not only because they are designed for the
<span class='pageno' title='312' id='Page_312'></span>
support of militarism, but because they are so largely
made up of indirect taxes that throw an unfair burden
on the poorer classes. To the high tariff, which,
after long discussion, came into operation in 1906,
they offered the most strenuous resistance. The Social
Democrats are also in general opposed to the colonial
policy of the empire. They are the champions of the
democratic rights of the people, of free speech, of a
free press, and especially of the right of combination,
which was lately threatened by the Emperor. In all
matters relating to factory legislation and the better
protection of the working class in its daily life and
vocation they are forward both to make suggestions
themselves and to assist any legislation which is really
fitted to contribute towards these important ends.
They claim, in fact, to be the representatives and advocates
in the widest sense of the working class of Germany,
and are opposed to all measures which tend to
strengthen the class State to which they are so entirely
opposed. While expressing a preference for peaceful
methods, they still regard as probable a great crisis or
catastrophe by which they will gain political power
and so realise their collectivist ideal. Such a crisis will,
they say, be brought on not by them but by the ruling
classes, of which the class State is the representative.</p>

<p>At the Annual Congress at Stuttgart in 1898 the
busts of Marx and Lassalle appeared on the platform
amidst laurels and palms. The busts of Lassalle, Karl
Marx, and Engels were grouped amidst ferns and flowers
round an allegorical figure of Liberty on the platform at
<span class='pageno' title='313' id='Page_313'></span>
the Hanover Congress of 1899. It is only right to add
that, with the development of Social Democracy in
Germany and throughout the world, the stage on which
these men appear seems to widen and their stature to
grow. Their writings, whether learned or popular, are
read and pondered in all lands of the civilised world,
sometimes leading to organisation and action, often to
latent thought and conviction ready to bear fruit in
due time. Lassalle and Karl Marx promise to be, if they
are not already, historical figures of the first magnitude.</p>

<p>It is also clear that, if the Social Democracy means
to be worthy to guide the destinies of the working
class of Germany, it must not stiffen and degenerate
into a sect. Its principles and tactics founded on the
views of Marx must be subject to continual discussion
and to revision. The party is disposed to take Marx
too literally, more literally than Marx took himself.
They have been disposed out of season to emphasise
the ultra-revolutionary side of Marx. We have already
seen that this ultra-revolutionary side of Marx was the
product of a time and of circumstances which no longer
prevail in Germany or elsewhere, or prevail at least in
a much milder degree. But there was another side to
Marx. It would not be fair to call it his opportunist
side. On this side Marx had regard to his environment,
as every man must have. Even in the communistic
manifesto Marx recommended co-operation
with other advanced parties for the attainment of
democratic ends. He recognised the possibilities of
progress contained in a peaceful evolution. Factory
<span class='pageno' title='314' id='Page_314'></span>
legislation and the co-operative movement in England
were not only good results, they were the victories of
new principles. As we have seen, he believed that in
America, England, and Holland the workmen might
attain their goal by peaceful means. In a milder time
it would only be consistent that this milder side of
Marx should be more emphasised by his followers.</p>

<p>The necessity for a criticism of Marx as a condition
of the further development of his teaching has recently
been pointed out by Eduard Bernstein, formerly editor
of the <span class='it'>Sozialdemokrat</span>. This criticism he attempted in
a memorial addressed to the Congress at Stuttgart,
and more fully in 1899 in a book <span class='it'>Die Voraussetzungen
des Sozialismus und die Aufgaben der Sozialdemocratie</span>.
Bernstein’s criticism is applied more or less to all the
leading positions of Marx, his materialistic conception
of history, his dialectical method, his theory of surplus
value, his revolutionary conception of social development
which looks forward to a great catastrophe as the
close of the capitalistic era. He maintains that statistics
do not favour the theory that a social catastrophe is
imminent as the result of a class war carried on by a
continually increasing host of impoverished and degraded
proletarians against a diminishing band of the
colossal magnates of capitalism, and has greater faith
in a peaceful evolution through the democratic transformation
of the State, the extension of municipal
socialism and of the co-operative movement. We need
not say that we believe that these criticisms are in the
right direction.
<span class='pageno' title='315' id='Page_315'></span></p>

<p>Bernstein’s book made a great stir in Germany, and
received a limited support at the Hanover meeting.
But a resolution, which was moved by Bebel in a long
and able speech, and which affirmed the old positions
of the party against Bernstein, was carried by an overwhelming
majority.</p>

<p>The abstract collectivism of the German Social
Democratic party is not fitted to ensure success among
the peasantry. Yet at the election of 1898 they gained
ground in many agricultural districts east of the Elbe.
We may presume that these results were obtained
chiefly among the purely labouring class as distinguished
from the men who own their farms. But they do
not despair of also winning over the peasant owners,
many of whom are heavily burdened with mortgages.
The peasant owner is often proprietor only in name,
being really caretaker for the mortgagee, and therefore
merely a dependent of the capitalist.</p>

<p>All previous successes of the German Social Democrats
were eclipsed by the triumph at the general
election of 1903, when they counted 3,010,000 votes,
and returned 81 members. Of the entire poll they
had 32 per cent, or nearly one-third. It was an
increase of 900,000.</p>

<p>The number of their seats in the Reichstag never
correspond to their votes at the elections. There has
been no Redistribution Act since the founding of the
Empire, and the strength of the party lies in the towns,
which have grown enormously since 1871. Even under
the most favourable circumstances they have little
<span class='pageno' title='316' id='Page_316'></span>
direct influence on the legislation of Germany, and still
less on the executive, which depends on the Emperor
and his ministers. The rôle prescribed to them by
their circumstances is vigilant scrutiny and outspoken
criticism. They are an opposition party. In fact,
they are more and more becoming the only effective
opposition party in Germany.</p>

<p>At the Jena meeting of 1905 the bust of Liebknecht,
who died in 1900, held a place of honour on the platform
beside those of Marx and Lassalle. Changes of
organisation aiming at greater energy and efficiency
were introduced. This meeting elected a party direction
(<span class='it'>Parteivorstand</span>) of two chairmen, four secretaries and
a treasurer, with the two assessors chosen by the
Board of Control. It thus consisted of nine members.
The Board of Control, which acts as check on this
executive, also numbers nine members. Among the
subjects discussed were the dearness of meat and other
necessaries of life caused by the German protective
system, and the question of the general strike, introduced
in a masterly speech by Bebel, who advocated
it as a possible resource in case universal suffrage be
withdrawn, or the right of combination be infringed by
the Government. A resolution in this sense was in
principle adopted by a very large majority. It was
confirmed at the Mannheim meeting in 1906.</p>

<p>The German Social Democrats do not insist on
universal suffrage in the hope of exercising any immediate
influence on the Government or in the Reichstag.
They regard it rather as an instrument of agitation and
<span class='pageno' title='317' id='Page_317'></span>
education. They seek to enlighten the masses of the
people, to make them of one mind on the political
and economic questions that concern them, to organise
and discipline them for the great task of emancipation.
Their main field of action is the people, not parliament.
Their ‘main aim is to win the whole working class for
socialism.’</p>

<p>In this aim their prospect of success depends on how
far they can win over the Catholic working men and the
rural population. With both they have so far gained
ground. It is not impossible that they may in time
prevail with both. In their principles and tactics there
is nothing now that need give offence to the religious
convictions of the Catholic electors. The rural population
could be won over by a suitable agrarian programme.
In these circumstances the Centre and the
Conservatives would alike have the ground taken away
from under their feet, and the German Government
would find itself in an untenable position. For in
such a case the army could hardly continue to be a
trustworthy support. The following significant passage
occurs in the speech of Bebel already referred to:—‘The
struggle in Russia sends a chill into the marrow-bones
of our rulers much more than you believe. They
have a deadly fear that the fire may cross the border.
They say to themselves, if that is possible in Russia
where there is no organisation, and the proletariat
is comparatively small, what then may happen in
Germany where we have politically enlightened
masses and an organised proletariat, where already
<span class='pageno' title='318' id='Page_318'></span>
there are not only battalions but whole regiments in
the army which consist of Social Democrats, and when
the Reserve and the Landwehr are called out, whole
brigades are formed of them?’<a id='r1_15'/><a href='#f1_15' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a> The raising of the tariff
has been to the party a most helpful subject of
agitation, which they have used to the uttermost.
Molkenbuhr, one of their leaders, looks forward to the
doubling of their adherents in a few years.</p>

<p>At the general election of 1907 the party had
3,260,000 votes, but owing to the more active combination
against it of other parties it returned only 43
members. The congress at Nürnberg in 1908 was
notable for the first serious opposition to the rigid
discipline of the party. The claim of the South German
members to vote for the budgets of their governments
was maintained by a minority of 119 against 258.</p>

<p>It was not till 1894 that a Social Democratic party
was founded in Holland. It is making progress: in
the general election of 1897 it counted 13,000 votes,
and returned 3 members out of 100. In 1901 it had
38,000 votes, and returned 7 members, and there was
besides an independent socialist member. It had
65,000 votes and 7 members in 1905. An interesting
feature of the Dutch movement is the sympathetic
reception which socialism has met among the artist
and intellectual class generally. It is curious that
anarchism has had considerable influence, which, however,
is declining.</p>

<p>In Denmark the social democratic movement began
<span class='pageno' title='319' id='Page_319'></span>
in 1871, and it continues to have a strong and growing
influence. At the general election of 1903 the party
returned 16 members out of 114, polling 56,000 votes.
In 1906 it polled 77,000 votes and returned 24
members to the popular chamber. For some time
before 1902 half of the members of the municipal
council of Copenhagen were socialists. The mayor
also was one of the party. Denmark may still rightfully
be regarded as the most progressive country in
Europe. Even in Norway and Sweden the socialists
are gaining ground. They claim to have wielded a
considerable influence in securing the peaceful separation
of the two countries.</p>

<p>No country in Europe has during recent years
had a more interesting social history than Belgium. In
hardly any country has the working class endured such
misery. Ignorance, long hours of labour and low
wages, the want of political rights and of organisation,
have for generations tended to keep the workers in
the lowest estate. All the more remarkable, therefore,
is the awakening which has recently taken place. The
Belgian socialist party can now muster at the polls
a voting strength of about half a million, and in a
chamber of 166 it returns about one-fifth. In 1900 it
had 33, in 1902 it had 34, in 1904 only 28, in 1906
it had 30, and 34 in 1908. The organisation of the trade-unions
is well developed. But the distinctive feature
of the social movement of Belgium is its co-operative
undertakings. These are affiliated to the socialist
movement, and form an admirable training on its more
<span class='pageno' title='320' id='Page_320'></span>
practical side. The Belgian socialist party is specially
fortunate in such leaders as Anseele and Vandervelde.</p>

<p>France, which was so long the foremost nation in
the revolutionary movement, has for the last three
decades yielded the first place to Germany. The
terrible disasters sustained by the working men of
Paris in 1848 and 1871 quelled their revolutionary
energy for a time. The first working men’s congress
after the Commune met in 1876, and at the congress of
Marseilles in 1879 a socialist party was organised. It
remained a united party till 1882, when it polled
98,000 votes. Since that year French socialism has
been fruitful in division. In view of the danger which
in 1899 appeared to threaten the Republic in connection
with the Dreyfus case, the socialist parties combined
in common action for its defence. For this
purpose they formed a permanent <span class='it'>comité d’entente
socialiste</span>. Five important socialist organisations were
included in the agreement. The good understanding
was broken when the socialist Millerand entered the
emergency Cabinet of that year. Without going into
details, it is enough to say that there have been two
main tendencies in French socialism—the uncompromising
revolutionary school which adheres to Marx,
and an opportunist or <span class='it'>possibilist</span> school which has
been ready to co-operate with other democratic parties.
The first-named school naturally objected to Millerand
entering the Cabinet.</p>

<p>Socialism is rapidly becoming a power in France.
According to M. Marcel Fournier, in the <span class='it'>Revue Politique
<span class='pageno' title='321' id='Page_321'></span>
et Parlementaire</span>, the radical socialists polled 171,810
votes at the general election of 1893 and 629,572 at
that of 1898, whilst the socialists polled 598,206 in
1893 and 791,148 in 1898. The <span class='it'>Parti Ouvrier</span> or Marx
party claimed to have cast 152,000 votes in 1893 and
371,000 in 1898. The socialist members in the Chamber
of 1898 numbered about fifty.</p>

<p>After 1900 two distinct parties, representing the two
tendencies of which I have spoken, were for a time
consolidated. The Socialist Party of France represented
the uncompromising section. The French Socialist
Party stood for the more opportunist policy. In 1902
the French socialists together polled 805,000 votes,
and returned 48 members to the Chamber of Deputies.
There was really very little difference between the two
leading parties, and they formed a union in 1905. At
the general election in 1906 it was calculated that
the whole socialist vote amounted to 1,120,000. The
unified party returned 52 members with 896,000 votes,
while 23 were described as independent socialists.
There were besides 143 radical socialists.</p>

<p>The radical and democratic republicans are to a
large degree dependent on labour and socialist support.
There is also a growing conviction that the political
principles of the Revolution of 1789, which are so
dear to the French heart, cannot be realised apart from
the economic principles which are comprehended in
socialism. In the great debate of Clemenceau with
Jaurèz in the Chamber in 1906 it was no impassable
gulf which separated radical and socialist. The former
<span class='pageno' title='322' id='Page_322'></span>
was in favour of a graduated income-tax, the eight
hours’ day, and the restoration of monopolies to the
State. What we may call the prevailing republican
atmosphere is most favourable to social justice and
the claims of labour. But it would be a very serious
mistake to believe that France is at all convinced
of the reasonableness or practicability of the abstract
collectivism of the socialist party. When a motion
for the substitution of collective property for individual
property was put to the vote at the close of
the debate, it was rejected by 505 to only 55. As at
present advised, France will have neither clericalism
nor collectivism.</p>

<p>The socialists form a majority in many of the most
important French communes, and exercise great practical
influence on their work. Thus they are taking a
large part in the national and local life of France.</p>

<p>Revolutionary feeling tending to anarchism has
considerable influence in France, especially among the
trade unions (<span class='it'>syndicats ouvriers</span>).</p>

<p>The Italian socialist party definitely separated itself
from anarchism and formed a distinct organisation at a
congress in Genoa in 1892. Its career has been a hard
and troubled one. There has been much discord in its
own household. The government was for some years
openly hostile. It has been concerned in many strikes
and popular disturbances. The working classes of Italy,
we must remember, were from an educational, economic,
and political point of view at an inferior stage of progress.
Between the various provinces, and especially
<span class='pageno' title='323' id='Page_323'></span>
between the north and south, the differences of development
were very serious. Italy has had long to suffer from
the burden of a divided and depressed historical past.</p>

<p>At the general election of 1892 the party had only
26,000 votes and returned 6 deputies. The next elections
showed a rapid increase, till in 1900 they counted
175,000 votes and returned 32 members to the Chamber.
On that occasion an alliance with the radicals and republicans
partly accounted for the increase of members
returned. At the general election of 1904 the party
had a voting strength of 320,000, but returned only 27
members.</p>

<p>For some time after 1900 the Government was not
only sympathetic, but in some degree dependent on the
party for support. As in other countries, there is a
reformist or moderate and a revolutionary wing in the
Italian socialist party. The latter takes a <span class='it'>syndicalist</span>
or trade-union form and is largely imbued with
anarchism. At the congress at Rome in 1906 a new
movement called <span class='it'>integralism</span> became supreme. The
integralists aimed at combining the best and most
effective methods of all sections, gradual reform when
possible, but violence also, and the general strike if
necessary. They are anti-monarchical and anti-clerical.</p>

<p>The Italian socialists have been active not only in
organising strikes but in municipal work and in co-operative
undertakings. A marked feature in the brief
history of the party has been its success in organising
the peasantry. One of these peasant combinations,
with a membership of 200,000, held a national congress
<span class='pageno' title='324' id='Page_324'></span>
at Bologna in 1901 and formed a national federation.
In that and the following year many agrarian strikes
were successful, and brought a little improvement in
the hard lot of the rural workers in Italy. It was a
notable awakening of labour, in which the party took a
leading share. When we consider the very backward
condition of Italy and the short period during which
the party has been in existence, we must regard its
success as remarkable.</p>

<p>After making some progress the Working-Men’s
Socialist Party of Spain has declined in recent years.
The number of its votes for the Chamber decreased
from 26,000 in 1904 to 23,000 in 1905. It has, however,
succeeded in sending representatives to a good
number of municipalities and communes. The political
and industrial life of Spain has been in a most depressed
condition.</p>

<p>Besides the Parliamentary Socialism, which is based
more or less on Marx, anarchism has always found a
congenial soil in Spain, Italy, and other countries where
misery and oppression have been hereditary for so
many centuries, and which even yet have not learned
habits of self-control, of free discussion, and open
action. It is such an unhappy environment that produced
the assassins of President Carnot, the Empress
of Austria, and King Humbert of Italy. Anarchism is
very powerful and widespread in the south of Spain.</p>

<p>We may note a rapid progress of socialism in Eastern
Europe. Even Servia and Bulgaria have socialist
parties, which are affiliated to the International. In
<span class='pageno' title='325' id='Page_325'></span>
Austria there is a numerous and active Social Democratic
Party, which has introduced the federal principle
into its organisation. It is a united party with a
common programme and tactics, but it is composed of
national groups—German, Czech, Polish, Italian, etc.,
each of which enjoys a real autonomy. In fact, the
party is an International on a small scale, of which the
basis as regards principles and tactics is national autonomy
and international solidarity. On the political side,
it holds that the real and vital forces of the State in
Austria can be developed only on the two principles of
national autonomy and complete democracy. On the
economic side the party adheres to the common principles
of socialism. At the general election of 1901
the party polled about 800,000 votes. Its most pressing
demand was for universal suffrage as necessary to
the political development of the country. After long
debate this was granted in 1907, in which year the
party polled 1,050,000 votes and returned 87 members
to the Reichsrath. The Christian Social Party returned
96 members with 722,000 votes. In view of the
medley of races and languages which exist in Austria,
the position and organisation of the party have a special
interest. The various national groups, we are told,
work together in perfect harmony.</p>

<p>The revolutionary movement in Russia had in
1881 its tragic culmination in the assassination of the
Emperor Alexander II. Though his successor Alexander
III. was for a time kept a prisoner in his palace
at Gatschina by fear of the revolutionists, the movement
<span class='pageno' title='326' id='Page_326'></span>
was suppressed, and for several years there was comparative
quiet. Among the innovating party a feeling
set in that they had been trying to force the march of
natural evolution, and a tendency prevailed to await
the time when the economic development of the country
would make revolutionary action practicable. Under
a very high tariff the industrial revolution made rapid
progress. Large factories soon led to the creation of a
numerous proletariat, with the usual strikes. A gigantic
strike at St. Petersburg in 1896 may be regarded as the
starting-point of a new revolutionary movement arising
naturally out of modern industrial conditions. A Social
Democratic Party, which laid great emphasis on the
doctrines of Marx, originated in this way. The Russian
socialists were for the first time represented at an International
Congress in London, 1896.</p>

<p>Groups of socialists, however, had been rising up
and taking shape all over the country, and it was felt
by many that they could not wait for the unfolding of
the economic evolution, and that in the special circumstances
of Russia a strenuous revolutionary action was
necessary. Some surviving members of the old revolutionary
party helped to supply the nucleus of a Socialist
Revolutionary Party, which was accordingly formed
towards the end of 1901. There were now two
important socialist parties in the empire: the Social
Democrats, who emphasised the need for awaiting the
economic development of Russia, including the full
creation of the proletariat, and the Socialist Revolutionary
Party. The first party had little hope of
<span class='pageno' title='327' id='Page_327'></span>
leading the peasantry into the movement, so long as
they were not expropriated by the growth of the great
estates. The second party insisted on an energetic
propaganda among the peasantry as well as an active
campaign against the Tzardom and its servants.</p>

<p>Besides these two parties we find in Lithuania,
Russian Poland, and other parts of Western Russia, a
socialist organisation of Jewish workmen called the
Bund. It is the peculiar fate of the Jews in Russia
that their revolutionary activity renders them obnoxious
to the Government, whilst the exactions of the usurers
and dealers of the same race make them hateful to
peasantry and workers. The Jewish question in Russia
can be understood only by due recognition of both
points.</p>

<p>The anarchists also are still active in Russia. And
among the peasantry there is an agrarian movement,
which may be regarded as the most powerful of all,
though vague and ill-organised. As we saw in our
chapter on anarchism, the revolution in Russia was
an exotic or importation from abroad in the reign of
Alexander II. It has now taken root in the soil and
very strongly shows the influence of conditions peculiar
to the country. Mutinies in fleet and army, strikes and
popular risings, massacres, assassinations, conflagration,
and pillage seem to portend the dissolution sooner or
later of an ancient society and a long-established autocracy.
The socialists have been the most active agents
in the appalling movement.</p>

<p>After the decline of the Owen agitation and of the
<span class='pageno' title='328' id='Page_328'></span>
Christian Socialist movement in 1850, socialism could
hardly be said to exist in England, and where it
attracted any attention at all, it was generally regarded
as a revolutionary curiosity peculiar to the Continent,
with little practical interest for a free and normal
country like our own. As we have seen, the English
workmen took a considerable share in the founding of
the International in 1864 and subsequently. But on
the fuller development of the revolutionary tendencies
of that movement, and especially after the great disaster
of the Commune at Paris, socialism lost the not very
serious hold which it had found among the English
working class. There had indeed always been a group
of men who were influenced by personal intercourse
with Karl Marx and Engels during their long residence
in this country, but they were mostly of foreign extraction,
and had no wide relations with the English workmen.</p>

<p>About 1883 English socialism took a fresh start,
indirectly through the influence of Henry George, and
directly through the teaching of Karl Marx. By his
vigorous and sympathetic eloquence Henry George
gained a hearing for opinions which were not distinctly
socialistic, but certainly tended to disturb the existing
modes of thought. Though it led to little positive
result, the agitation connected with his name was
really the beginning of a radical change in English
economics. A variety of causes, among which we may
mention the agrarian agitation in Ireland, and the
legislation which was designed to meet it, had contributed
<span class='pageno' title='329' id='Page_329'></span>
to shake the confidence of the English public in
the finality of the accepted economic doctrines.</p>

<p>The recent English socialism had, in 1884, a definite
beginning with the Social Democratic Federation,
which, with great fervour, denounced the existing
system and proclaimed the views of Marx. Most
active and prominent in this movement was Mr.
Hyndman; the most eminent was the robust and
genial figure of William Morris, widely known as the
author of the <span class='it'>Earthly Paradise</span>, and one of the foremost
of living poets. The chief literary product of the
movement at this early stage was Hyndman’s <span class='it'>Historical
Basis of Socialism in England</span>. The organ of the
Federation was, and continues to be, <span class='it'>Justice</span>.</p>

<p>About the end of the year 1885 the Socialist League
diverged from the Federation on grounds of difference,
which were partly personal, partly of principle, for the
League showed a decided sympathy with the anarchist
theory of socialism. Morris himself, its leading
member, had anarchist leanings, which come out
clearly in <span class='it'>News from Nowhere</span> and other works.
Belfort Bax, another prominent member of the League,
has published <span class='it'>Ethics of Socialism</span> and other works,
which represent the extreme and uncompromising side
of the movement. The <span class='it'>Commonweal</span> was the organ of
the League. The League and its organ, however, did
not survive many years.</p>

<p>The year 1884 also saw the beginning of a
Socialist Society of a nature different from the above.
This was the Fabian Society, whose members were
<span class='pageno' title='330' id='Page_330'></span>
mostly young men, clever, full of initiative, and little
disposed to bow before accepted authority. They are
socialists whose aim has been first to educate themselves
in the economic, social, and political questions of
the time, and then to educate the English people in
their views, or, to use their own language, to “permeate”
English Society with progressive socialist
ideas. <span class='it'>The Fabian Essays on Socialism</span>, by seven of its
leading members, published in 1890, a work which has
been the chief literary product of the Society, have had
a great success. By its popular lectures and discussions,
by its tracts and its articles in the monthly
reviews, as well as by its activity in the press, the
Fabian Society has undoubtedly done much toward the
permeation of public opinion with a progressive evolutionary
socialism. The tracts, of which there is now a
large number, have been always able, generally well
informed, and often brilliant. A tract by one of its
members on the Workmen’s Compensation Act, issued
in 1898, had a circulation of 120,000 the first year of
its publication. Important works on a large scale
have been <span class='it'>The History of Trade Unionism</span> and <span class='it'>Industrial
Democracy</span> by Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Webb.
The writings of Mr. G. B. Shaw and of Mr. H. G. Wells
have done much to startle men’s minds out of the old
way of thinking. In 1908 the membership of the
Fabian Society had increased to 2500 in the London
society, and 500 more in local societies. We give its
Basis in the Appendix.</p>

<p>The Independent Labour Party, formed in 1893,
<span class='pageno' title='331' id='Page_331'></span>
was an organisation of socialists with a view to
political action. It was to a large extent an offshoot
from Fabianism in the provinces, and many of its
leading members are Fabians. It has kept itself in
close touch with trade unions.</p>

<p>All sections of recent English socialism have included
men of real ability and culture, and the movement
has been marked by sincere conviction, generous
enthusiasm, and hard work in a great cause. For some
years after its rise, in 1883, it had considerable influence
in the country. Its mission was to rouse men
of all classes out of the individualistic routine which
had so long been prevalent. Trade unionists and co-operators
were the objects of denunciation not less
unsparing than that which they poured upon the
middle class. The disturbances in Trafalgar Square in
1887 made no little stir; and the Dock Strike in
London, which was so ably conducted by John
Burns in 1889, for a time gave the movement a
national importance. It almost seemed at one period
as if English public opinion was veering round to
Socialism. The reaction which was bound to set
in was certainly due in part to the vehemence
and extravagance of the socialistic orators, and to
their want of skill and insight in adapting their
theories to the atmosphere of the English mind.
It is clear that recent English socialism has been
too loyal to Marx. This particularly applies to the
Social Democratic Federation, now the Social Democratic
Party. But even the Fabian basis has implications
<span class='pageno' title='332' id='Page_332'></span>
which are ultra-revolutionary, and hardly
consistent with a peaceful and orderly evolution.</p>

<p>At the general election of 1895, the organised
socialism in England polled only about 45,000 votes.
The mass of the English working men still voted with
the old political parties. On the other hand, the
Trade Union Congresses, representing over a million
workers, for several years passed resolutions of a
collectivist nature by large majorities, showing that
when the man or men appear that know how to give
voice and form to the half-articulate or latent socialism
of the country it may have a great future.</p>

<p>In 1900 steps were taken towards the political
organisation of labour on a wider scale than formerly.
There was formed a Labour Representation Committee
in which trade unions, the Independent Labour Party,
the Social Democratic Federation, and the Fabian
Society were represented. The Social Democratic
Federation retired, however, at the end of the first year.</p>

<p>The new committee had been too recently formed
to take much part in the general election of 1900.
Yet it then returned two members, and two more at
subsequent by-elections. At the general election of
1906 it had a great success, and produced an impression
even greater on the national mind. As there was no
definite dividing line at the election between socialism
and labour on the one hand, or between labour and
liberalism on the other, it is impossible to speak precisely
as to the results. The committee had 323,000
votes and returned 30 members to the House of
<span class='pageno' title='333' id='Page_333'></span>
Commons. There was also a labour or trade-union
group, which formed part of the Liberal Party. We
may reckon the labour members at 54, of whom about
half were socialists.</p>

<p>After the election the Labour Representation Committee
transformed itself into the Labour Party, and
very wisely decided not to formulate a programme.
The new party had behind it a million adherents, of
whom 21,000 were members of socialist societies, the
rest being trade unionists. Mr. Keir Hardie had taken
the leading share in the formation of a Labour Party
distinct from the old political parties. In 1908 the
trade unions and especially the Miners’ Federation
which were represented by the liberal-labour group
resolved to join the Labour Party, but this decision
was not to be operative with regard to sitting members
during the existing parliament. The same year the
Labour Party was definitely affiliated to the International.
It now represented one and a half million
of adherents.</p>

<p>The Labour Party, whose origin we have briefly
described, may fairly be regarded as a successful
attempt on a worthy scale to form a labour-socialist
organisation suited to British conditions. It appears
to be commendably free from the excessive Marx
influence; but in many important questions it has
not thrown off old radical views which are inconsistent
with a reasonable and enlightened socialism.</p>

<p>What we may call the avowed and organised socialism
has made no great headway in the United States
<span class='pageno' title='334' id='Page_334'></span>
of America or in the English colonies. Books like
Bellamy’s <span class='it'>Looking Backward</span> have made a great impression,
but in a vague way. Labour questions
have, on the other hand, attained to a very high
state of development. The struggle between trade-unionism
and the employers’ combinations is carried
on with an energy and comprehensiveness which can
hardly be equalled in any part of the old world.</p>

<p>Australia has a Labour Party which is well organised
and well led and takes a most honourable place in the
recently constituted Commonwealth. It even formed
the government in 1904, though it did not retain power
long. It is, however, most powerful when out of power,
as it then holds the balance between the other two
parties. The party is to a great degree socialistic in
aim and tendency. It was in power again in 1908.</p>

<p>During recent years we have seen in America a
transformation which is without parallel in the history
of the world. Till the middle of the nineteenth
century the United States might be described as an
agricultural country, which, apart from negro slavery,
had no division of classes, no poverty, and no social
question. It was a highly favoured region which to
the most energetic and enterprising of the working
classes of Europe had for generations been a Land of
Promise. The early settlers had in the main brought
from England all that was best and highest in respect
of character, belief, and institutions. In particular, for
the planting of New England the “finest of the wheat”
was sifted from the most progressive counties of
<span class='pageno' title='335' id='Page_335'></span>
England; and as the area of emigration widened it
embraced the best elements in the British Isles and in
north-western Europe, the best endowed and the most
progressive in the world. The country they came to
live in had resources, and offered opportunities which
were almost boundless. In the development of the
country from the first settlement of Virginia, there was
just enough of difficulty to stimulate and correct the
energies of a free people.</p>

<p>A marvellous set of new conditions came into
operation in the latter half of the nineteenth century.
The industrial revolution ran its course with astonishing
rapidity and thoroughness, and on a scale absolutely
unprecedented. The Republic now has a gigantic
machine industry and a vast railway and financial
system organised in trusts which are controlled by a
few men wealthy beyond example in history, and it
has also got a large wage-earning class, the unemployed,
poverty and slums. If the commonwealth has not
already become a plutocracy, it appears to be on the
downward way to it.</p>

<p>If the wage-earning class consisted of fully trained
American citizens, the situation would be clearer. It is
complicated by the fact that for many years the
Republic has received an enormous number of immigrants
from the less-advanced countries of eastern
and southern Europe, and has the very difficult task of
raising them to its own high standard of citizenship.
The general result is that America is confronted with
the vast problem, which socialism has undertaken to
<span class='pageno' title='336' id='Page_336'></span>
solve, in its most formidable form. Between a highly
organised and gigantic capitalism and a continually
increasing labour class which is largely composed of
new immigrants, and is only partially organised, a wide
gulf is fixed. A growing chasm threatens to divide
the commonwealth in two. This rent is made manifest
in the strikes, which degenerate into private war and
even into civil war. Socialists maintain that they
have been repressed with a severity and brutality
known in Russia alone. As yet the organised socialism
has made only moderate progress. In 1902, however,
a resolution in favour of socialism obtained about half
the votes at the congress of the American Federation of
Labour, which numbered over 2,000,000 members. At
the presidential election of 1904 the socialist candidate
Eugène V. Debs received 408,000 votes, in 1908 he had
500,000 votes. It was widely recognised that the presidential
election of 1908 turned on the vote of organised
labour. The Republican and Democratic candidates
both made special appeal to organised labour and
made a special effort to gain its vote. It is obvious
that the gigantic growth of the trust system in America
has quickened inquiry into the most fundamental questions
of industrial and social order. The programme of
the Knights of Labour was for many years the nearest
approach to socialism made by any great labour combination
in America. But there can be no doubt now
that America contains all the elements which favour
the growth of socialism, and especially of the labour
organisations which make for socialism.
<span class='pageno' title='337' id='Page_337'></span></p>

<p>The result of our brief review is, that in most
countries of Europe the avowed and organised socialism
has a formidable and rapidly increasing number of
adherents. It is equally clear that socialistic theories
have made a wide and deep impression on the
opinion of most countries of the civilised world.
Socialism has been a standing challenge to the
economic theories so long prevalent: it is a protest
against the existing social-economic order; and as such
it has been discussed on every platform, in all
journals, and we may venture to say in every private
gathering, with some comprehension of its nature and
aims. Whatever the issue may be, it is very improbable
that reasonable men can ever again regard the
competitive system of economics with the same satisfaction
as formerly. The mere fact that we can
survey and analyse great ideas and institutions with
critical objectiveness is a proof that we are looking
back upon them, and that we have already so far
left them behind in the onward march of progress. In
countries where the socialistic theory is accepted in its
entirety only by a few, it has nevertheless effected a
great change in opinion. It is hardly an exaggeration
to say that the orthodox political economy, if it exist
anywhere, survives only in old books and in the minds
of a diminishing band of doctrinaires. Friends of the
existing order would now almost have us believe that
the old competitive political economy never existed at
all, which at least may be taken as a sufficient proof
that its days are numbered. Under these circumstances
<span class='pageno' title='338' id='Page_338'></span>
it is not surprising that we do not at present
possess a settled political economy.</p>

<p>We may best consider the growing influence of
socialistic ideas on current opinion under the following
heads:—</p>

<p>1. On the theory of the State’s relation to labour.—The
attitude of most governments to the organised
socialism is naturally unfriendly; but the accepted
view of the relation of the State to the working and
suffering classes has marvellously changed in recent
years. Whereas not many years ago the policy and
principles of government took little account of the
masses of the people, it is now a recognised duty of the
State to care for them. So complete has the transformation
been, that it will soon require a considerable
knowledge of history to realise it, for the times when
the claims of the lower orders were ignored are already
beginning to pass out of the memory of the younger
and most active portion of the community.</p>

<p>2. The relation of political economy to socialism.—We
have already referred to the influence of social
problems on the classical political economy of this
country. The development of J. S. Mill’s economic
views from loyal adherence to Ricardo, to a reasonable
socialism, cannot be regarded as representative,
seeing that he has so entirely outstripped his scholars.
In recent important works on economics we see indeed
only a moderate recognition of the new influences, but
they do not command the assent of the public as formerly,
the result being that English Political Economy
<span class='pageno' title='339' id='Page_339'></span>
remains in a most unsettled problematical and unsatisfactory
condition.</p>

<p>Here again Germany leads the way. The socialism
of the chair is not to any large extent really socialistic.
But it includes among its representatives eminent
professors and other economists, who recognise the
historical and ethical sides of political economy, who
go far in giving labour problems their due place in
the treatment of their subject, and who have made
most important concessions to the socialistic criticism
of the existing society and the prevalent political
economy. One of the most notable of living German
economists and sociologists, Albert Schäffle, is more
than historical; his great work <span class='it'>Bau und Leben des
socialen Körpers</span> is a construction of society from the
evolution point of view. In the same work he has even
expressed his conviction that ‘the future belongs to
the purified socialism,’ though later utterances make
his attitude somewhat doubtful. However that may
be, he has brought to the study of social problems a
combination of learning, of philosophic insight directed
by the best light of his time, and of sympathy inspired
by the cause of the poor man, which is not equalled
by any living economist. No great living economist
has been so powerfully influenced by socialist speculation.</p>

<p>3. The relation of the Christian Church to socialism.—It
is a most serious mistake to suppose that there
can be any real antagonism between the ethical and
spiritual teaching of Christianity and the principles of
<span class='pageno' title='340' id='Page_340'></span>
socialism rightly understood. The difficulty is how to
reconcile the prevalent competitive system with any
reasonable conception of Christian ethics. We can now
see that Christianity was a strong assertion of the moral
and spiritual forces against the struggle for existence,
which had assumed such a hard, cruel, and vicious form
in ancient civilisation and in the Roman world. The
Christian Church did much to soften and then to abolish
slavery and serfdom, into which the peoples defeated
in the struggle for existence had been forced. A
right comprehension of the Christian life and of the
spirit and tendency of Christian history should show that
the Church should also use its influence against the continuance
of the struggle for existence in the competitive
system, and in favour of the less fortunate who in the
course of that form of struggle have been driven to precarious
wage-labour as their only means of livelihood.</p>

<p>Some of the prominent spokesmen of the Church
have clearly seen that the competitive system is not consistent
with Christian teaching. As we have already
seen, Maurice and Kingsley denounced the Manchester
school, started the Christian Socialist movement of 1848,
and gave a very considerable impetus to co-operation.</p>

<p>The participation of the Catholic Church of Germany
in the social question dates from the period of the
Lassalle agitation. In 1863 Döllinger recommended
that the Church should intervene in the movement,
and Bishop von Ketteler of Mainz lost no time in
expressing sympathy with Lassalle. In a treatise
entitled <span class='it'>Die Arbeiterfrage und das Christenthum</span> (1864)
<span class='pageno' title='341' id='Page_341'></span>
Ketteler criticised the liberalism of the Manchester
school in substantially the same terms as Lassalle, and
recommended the voluntary formation of productive
associations with capital supplied by the faithful. In
1868 the Catholic Socialism of Germany took a more
practical form: it started an organ of its own and began
to organise unions for the elevation of the working
men. The principles of the movement were with some
precision expounded by Canon Moufang in an electoral
address at Mainz in 1871, and by the writers in their
organ.</p>

<p>All agree in condemning the principles of liberalism,
especially in its economic aspects, as destructive of
society and pernicious to the working man, who, under
the pretence of freedom, is exposed to all the precariousness
and anarchy of competition and sacrificed to
the Iron Law of Wages. Self-help as practised in the
Schulze-Delitzsch schemes is also considered to be no
sure way of deliverance. The general remedy is union
on Catholic principles, especially the formation of trade-guilds
suited to modern exigencies, which some of their
leaders would make a compulsory measure enforced by
the State. The views of Moufang, which are most
definite, may thus be summarised: legal protection for
the workers, especially as regards hours of labour,
wages, the labour of women and children, sanitation;
subventions for workmen’s productive associations;
lightening of taxes on labour; control of the moneyed
and speculating interests. In the organisation of
unions the success of Catholic Socialism has been
<span class='pageno' title='342' id='Page_342'></span>
great; and for several years the Social Democrats made
no progress in Catholic districts.</p>

<p>The socialist activity of the Protestant Church of
Germany dates from 1878. The most important
literary product of the movement is a work by Pastor
Todt entitled <span class='it'>Der radikale deutsche Socialismus und die
christliche Gesellschaft</span>. In this work Todt condemns
the economics of liberalism as unchristian, and seeks
to show that the ideals of liberty, equality, and
fraternity are entirely Scriptural, as are also the
socialist demands for the abolition of private property
and of the wage system, that the labourer should have
the full produce of his labour, and that labour should
be associated. The chief leader of the movement was
the Court preacher Stöcker, the head also of the anti-Semitic
agitation, which is largely traceable to economic
causes. Stöcker founded two associations—a central
union for social reform, consisting of members of the
middle classes interested in the emancipation of labour,
and a Christian social working men’s party. The
former has had considerable success, especially among
the Lutheran clergy. The movement met with the
most strenuous resistance from the Social Democratic
party, and was greatly hampered by the anti-socialist
law of 1878.</p>

<p>In recent years all the sections of the Christian
Church in England have felt the influence of the
democratic movement, and have shown a commendable
interest in social questions. Among Catholics the most
notable representative of this new spirit was Cardinal
<span class='pageno' title='343' id='Page_343'></span>
Manning. The Report on Socialism made to the
Pan-Anglican Conference, which met at Lambeth in
1888, by the committee appointed to deal with the
question, was also a remarkable sign of the times. This
Report accepted what should be regarded as the main
aim of socialism—the reunion of capital and labour
through the principle of association. Without expressing
an opinion on the Report, the Conference commended
it to the consideration of the people. The Christian
Social Union, founded in 1889 by members of the
Church of England, has done good service. Its aim
is to study ‘how to apply the moral truths and
principles of Christianity to the social and economic
difficulties of the present time.’ The late Dr. Westcott,
Bishop of Durham, took a leading part in founding
and guiding it. It is open to Conservatives and
Liberals, socialists and non-socialists, who accept its
main aim, as above stated. In a pamphlet on <span class='it'>Socialism</span>
Dr. Westcott gives one of the best and finest expositions
of the principles of the subject which we have read.</p>

<p>The sympathetic attitude towards labour shown at
the Lambeth Conference of 1888 was maintained also
at the Conferences of 1897 and 1908. Very noteworthy
was the favourable reception given to socialistic
expressions of opinion at the Pan-Anglican Congress
which preceded the Conference of 1908, though it
would obviously be a mistake to assume that it meant
the acceptance of any definite collectivist economic
creed. A like sympathetic feeling has been shown in
many nonconformist quarters. Dr. Clifford, so eminent
<span class='pageno' title='344' id='Page_344'></span>
as a nonconformist leader, is a socialist and member
of the Fabian Society.</p>

<p>4. It is needless to speak of the great revolution in
current opinion regarding labour, as reflected in the
press and in contemporary literature. All is changed
since the time when Carlyle and Ruskin lifted up their
voices in the wilderness to an unbelieving generation!
All that is best, all that is tenable in the teaching of
those two great men is comprehended in socialism
rightly understood.</p>

<p>5. Nor is it necessary to say anything of the greatest
change of all, which has taken place in the opinions
and feelings of the masses of working men, who constitute
the modern democracy. Few men, however,
really understand the new power that has arisen in the
growing intelligence of the workers, in the discontent,
in the passion for improvement, in the hopes and
aspirations which so deeply move them. It has not
yet found adequate expression, direction, and organisation;
but every year it is making fresh advance towards
clearness of aim. A main part of the significance of
Marx’s activity lay in the fact that he strove to give
utterance and organisation to this vast and growing
mass of vague and half-conscious sentiment. In the
future we can but hope that it will receive wise and
salutary guidance.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br/><br/>TENDENCIES TOWARDS SOCIALISM</h2>

<p>So much may fairly be said regarding the influence of
socialistic speculation on the opinion of the civilised
world. It must be admitted, however, that as yet the
change is mainly in the region of opinion. For in the
domain of practice the competitive system, in spite of
many very important modifications, still holds the
field; and the old Political Economy, though greatly
discredited, still finds its strongest justification in the
fact that it is a reasonably accurate analysis of an
existing and working system. When asked for any
grounds that may be brought forward for believing that
the socialistic ideal is becoming a reality, we can only
point to symptoms or tendencies, not to definite results
on a scale commensurate with the development of
modern industry.</p>

<p>Yet these tendencies are large, most significant, and
visibly increasing. The following are the main lines
along which they may be observed:—</p>

<p>1. The State, which by a reasonable socialism should be
regarded as the association of men on a large scale, and as
such should continue to have a most important function.
<span class='pageno' title='346' id='Page_346'></span></p>

<p>2. The Municipality, or Commune, which, notwithstanding
certain objections, is the more convenient
word, as it includes the parish as well as the municipality,
and which should be regarded as the association
for local purposes. As every one knows how greatly
the range of State and municipal action for the common
good has been extended in recent years, we need
not enlarge on this aspect of our subject. But in
what we have to say it will be convenient to consider
the State and the local body together, as they are
really complements of each other. In a well-ordered
community there should be no real opposition between
the two. Under the conditions which now prevail
there can be no nourishing local life except in reasonable
relation to an efficient central organ; and the
central organ can do its part wisely and effectively
only by allowing suitable scope to local energy. No
absolute rules can be laid down for the relations of the
two to each other; these must be determined by considerations
of time and circumstance. But the problem
of their opposition under any <span class='it'>régime</span> can be a difficulty
only for unwise statesmanship.</p>

<p>It may not be a new thing in theory, that the State
should be an association for the promotion of the common
interests of all its members, or that the commune
should be an association for the general good of the
inhabitants of a locality; but it is practically new.
It is only during the last generation that the people
who form the majority of every society have received
any reasonable consideration from the organs of the
<span class='pageno' title='347' id='Page_347'></span>
State. We have during the last seventy years seen a
tardy reversal of the old injustice in our own country,
and for some years the movement towards improvement
has been growing apace. But our leading statesmen
seem even yet to be reluctant or only half willing
to advance. The domestic history of recent times is
the record of concessions made, not because the leaders
of either of our great parties particularly approved of
them, but because they were demanded by large sections
of voters. In fact the initiative in legislation
has now passed from the statesmen to the democracy.
We can hardly regard it as the outcome of a reasoned
and comprehensive theory of the State when politicians
trained in the theory and practice of <span class='it'>laissez-faire</span> in
1908 passed an Old Age Pensions Bill, which under
certain restrictions gave a pension of 5s. a week to
persons over 70.</p>

<p>The statesmen of Germany have been more consistent;
for when they inaugurated their schemes of
State socialism they frankly proclaimed their adhesion
to its principles. In this they were encouraged by the
old law of Prussia, which recognised the duty of the
State to provide subsistence for those who could not
make a living, and labour for those who were out of
employment. The position of the Prussian kingdom
has always been such that it required to foster the
full strength of the State by all available means, and
therefore could not afford to neglect any considerable
portion of its population. In his State socialism,
therefore, Bismarck could appeal with some show of
<span class='pageno' title='348' id='Page_348'></span>
reason to the traditional policy of Prussia. But it was
really a new departure.</p>

<p>Its leading principles were announced in an Imperial
message to the Reichstag on the 17th of
November 1881. Besides the repressive measures
necessary to restrain the excesses of the Social
Democracy, the Emperor declared that the healing of
social evils was to be sought in positive measures for
the good of the working man. The measures proposed
were for the insurance of the workmen against accident,
sickness, old age, and inability to work, by arrangements
under State control. ‘The finding of the right
ways and means for this State protection of the working
man is a difficult task, but also one of the highest
duties that concern every society standing on the
ethical foundations of the Christian national life.’ The
aged Emperor next went on to say that he would look
back with greater satisfaction on the successes with
which Providence had visibly blessed his reign, if he
could bequeath to the Fatherland new and lasting
pledges of peace at home, and to the needy greater
security and larger means for rendering the help to
which they had a claim. The message also spoke of
‘organising the life of the people in the form of
corporative associations under the protection and
furtherance of the State, to render possible the solution
of problems which the central power alone cannot
undertake.’ The Imperial programme has now been
realised. It may be regarded as the beginning of
better things to come. The help provided by its
<span class='pageno' title='349' id='Page_349'></span>
various measures is scanty enough, but no one can
reasonably doubt that it is immeasurably superior to
our English Poor Law.</p>

<p>So much for State socialism in Germany. To find
a democracy which is really government of the people
by the people for the people, we must go to our
colonies at the antipodes. It is a democracy which
both in theory and practice has most fully recognised
that the State is an association for the promotion of
the well-being of the whole people. New Zealand,
one of the youngest of the English colonies, is the
finest example of such a State. The State in New
Zealand owns and works railways, telegraphs, and
telephones. When the Bank of New Zealand was on
the point of stopping payment, with the most disastrous
results to the country, the government came
to its help with a guarantee of £4,000,000 and made
it a State institution. It made advances of cheap
money to settlers and passed legislation to break up
large estates. The laws for the protection of labour
are of the most advanced type. It settles labour disputes
by compulsory arbitration, and has in operation
an old-age pension scheme by which persons over 65
years of age receive an annual pension. At first fixed
at £18, this has been raised to £26, or 10s. a week. It
has introduced women’s suffrage, graduated taxation,
a complete system of local option in the drink trade,
a public system of life insurance and of medical care,
and a public trustee with very wide and beneficent
powers.
<span class='pageno' title='350' id='Page_350'></span></p>

<p>All these measures and others which we need not
name are the outcome in New Zealand of a great wave
of agrarian labour and socialistic feeling which spread
over the world about twenty years ago. It has been
well described as socialism without dogma. Every
measure has been examined and approved on its merits.
The policy therefore is all the more valuable as a mass
of testimony to the beneficent tendency of a reasonable
socialism. The conditions have no doubt been exceptionally
favourable. New Zealand is a young
country with great natural advantages and a small
population which has a very high average of intelligence,
initiative, and energy. It is an example, however,
which should be most encouraging to the world,
as it shows what may be done in a true democracy,
where the government is in entire sympathy with the
people and responsive to their wishes. The high
honour of carrying out this model legislation belongs
to Richard Seddon and his associates. Seddon was
Prime Minister of New Zealand from 1893 to his death
in 1906.</p>

<p>3. The co-operative society or association for the
ordinary purposes of industry.—Co-operation for some
time made comparatively little progress in production,
but when we consider the low point from which the
movement started, only about sixty years ago, and
how painfully capital, experience, and skill had to be
acquired by the poor workers, we should rather be
surprised at the advance that has been made in so
many progressive countries. It is only a partial
<span class='pageno' title='351' id='Page_351'></span>
realisation of the socialistic ideal, but it is well founded,
solid, and most promising. Its strongest point is that
it has arisen directly out of the people and remains
in close touch with them.</p>

<p>In England a co-operative society is usually a group
of workers who manage distribution with their joint
capital in their own interests. The group is entirely
democratic, open to every one, organised on the principle
of one man one vote, and choosing their own
committee or executive; the manager is a social
functionary; no member can legally hold more than
£200 of capital in any society. Production, especially
for domestic consumption, has now made very great
progress. In 1907 the movement had 1566 registered
societies and 2,434,000 members. By that date the £28
with which the movement started in 1844 had expanded
into a capital of £32,000,000, with an annual turnover of
£105,000,000, and an annual profit of £12,000,000. It
provides for the consumption of one-fifth of the population.
The co-operative movement in Great Britain is
already an industrial and economic power of no mean
order. If it has not solved the social question, it has
at least done much to clear the way towards a solution.
The movement is also making rapid progress in Germany,
Austria, Belgium, France, and Italy, and its greatest
successes are in other fields than distribution. In
Denmark the co-operative system is one of the brightest
features of recent history. More recently a co-operative
movement of great promise has begun in Ireland.</p>

<p>The co-operative society, therefore, is a self-governing
<span class='pageno' title='352' id='Page_352'></span>
group of workers, which has already made very considerable
progress in controlling the economic interests
of the labouring class. Not a little disappointment is
felt that it has not accomplished greater results; as
we believe, without good ground. It might reasonably
have been expected that human nature would survive
among co-operators, and that the self-regarding principle
would continue to be the mainspring of individual
action. Better social arrangements can only provide
for it a more efficient system of regulation.</p>

<p>It is particularly regrettable that co-operative
societies have not always had sufficient regard for their
employees. There can be little doubt that the contrast
between producers and consumers, and between the
centralising and de-centralising tendencies in organisation,
will long be a difficulty among co-operators, who
do not thoroughly understand the new system to which
they belong. Yet it should also be said that many of
the objections raised by the critics of the movement
are really due to the fact that they do not understand
its real nature, and imagine that they find old things
where really they meet only old names.</p>

<p>The noblest embodiment of the co-operative idea
is to be found in one of the oldest seats of industry
in Western Europe. This is the Vooruit (Forward)
Society, which was founded at Ghent in a season of
scarcity by Edouard Anseele and a few weavers in
1873. It was started with a capital of 84 francs
and 93 centimes, about £3: 8s., at first naturally as a
bakery, and has grown till it embraces the economy
<span class='pageno' title='353' id='Page_353'></span>
and life of about 100,000 out of the 165,000
inhabitants of the city. Besides the enormous and
splendidly-equipped bakeries, it has huge stores and
the largest cotton factory in Ghent, with an eight-hours’
day. It has its own printing works, a daily and
weekly press, its own system of life insurance, and old-age
pensions. It offers to its members at its People’s
Palace the means of education and of wholesome recreation
and it encourages art. This is a great achievement
in a country where Church and State, landlord
and capitalist, have so long combined to keep the
workers in the lowest ignorance and degradation. The
Vooruit has been a model to similar co-operative
enterprises not only in Belgium, but in France, Holland,
and Germany.</p>

<p>4. Of all the recent movements for the better ordering
of society in England, we believe the co-operative
movement to be the most hopeful, because the most
thorough and practical, but it is only one of many.
During the last half-century we have seen a long succession
of efforts, partially successful, towards a new
organisation of society rendered necessary by the
changes due to the industrial revolution. In all
spheres the watchword of the new era has been freedom,
the removal of restraint. But it has been found
that positive measures of reconstruction were also
necessary. Factory legislation carried in opposition to
the prevailing economic theory, trade-unions, employers’
combinations, industrial partnerships, boards
of conciliation, the co-operative system,—all these are
<span class='pageno' title='354' id='Page_354'></span>
real, if partial, endeavours towards a new organisation
of society suited to the new conditions. They are all
modifications and limitations imposed on the competitive
system, and to them the progress of the last
sixty years is largely due. Socialism claims to be the
comprehensive scheme of organisation which embraces
in a complete and consistent unity all these partial
efforts.</p>

<p>5. But the most striking feature of recent economic
history is the continuation of the movement which
began with the industrial revolution. Through this
process the small producer was superseded by the
capitalist, the smaller capitalist by the larger. And
now the single capitalist is being absorbed by the company,
an increasing proportion of the world’s business
being so vast that only a great company can provide
the requisite capital and organisation; whilst in the
large companies, in case they cannot drive each other
out of the field, there is a marked tendency to bring
about a fusion of interests. In all this we see a great
constructive process going on as the result of the
inherent laws of industrial development.</p>

<p>The movement is active in our own country; but
it is far surpassed in magnitude and activity by similar
phenomena in the United States of America, where it
is favoured by special circumstances. Under the protective
system the economic development of America
has proceeded without being disturbed by the industrial
power of England. It is a self-contained and self-sufficing
continent with a vast area and enormous natural
<span class='pageno' title='355' id='Page_355'></span>
resources. The people have not such a wide variety of
political, social, literary, and artistic interests as have the
ruling classes of England, and have therefore been all
the more keenly engaged in the exploitation of the new
world that lay open to them. Capitalism in America
has shown an energy, acuteness, and fertility of resource
which even in England are unparalleled. But
in the various departments of industry the chiefs have
found that competition may be suicidal and mutually
destructive, and have therefore seen it expedient to
arrange with each other for the regulation of production,
of prices and wages. Hence the trusts, or
great combinations of capitalists, which now confront
American society and the American Republic, and
which, as the latest development of capitalism, are
well calculated to excite scientific curiosity in every
country.</p>

<p>The trust system is, however, by no means confined
to America. A like organisation under the name of
cartels or syndicates is, in proportion to the size of
the country, almost equally strong in Germany. In
forms more or less open and undisguised it is spreading
in England, Austria, and other lands. It may be regarded
as an inevitable stage in the natural history of
capitalism.</p>

<p>Thus far have we come through the natural growth
of the company. If we consider the nature and development
of the company, we shall find that it is not
entirely undemocratic. The directors are, in principle
at least, elected and removable by the shareholders.
<span class='pageno' title='356' id='Page_356'></span>
And as the shares are open for purchase by any one,
a porter may be a shareholder in the railway company
of which he is a servant, with, so far, a voice in the
management. But in point of fact the companies are
owned and controlled by the capitalist classes, and are
a development of capitalism. The directors are usually
large capitalists. Their main aim is to produce
dividends. The relation of the management to the
employees cannot have much of a kindly, human, and
personal element.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the development of the company
in a large degree means that the real administration of
the economic movement is passing out of the hands
of the owner of capital as such. The companies are
for the most part managed by paid officials, who may
or may not have a substantial holding in the capital.
That is, the capitalists do not really manage the companies
in which their capital is embarked. The
manager, with a staff of paid officials, has become the
pivot of the industrial movement. Generally speaking,
the large company is more amenable to social regulation
than a variety of small enterprises. And now we
see that the natural development of the company has
prepared the whole organisation necessary for its
complete transference to social ownership and control,
if such a step were deemed advisable. A great railway
or system of water-supply can be transferred to State
or municipal control without any particular change in
the organisation by which it is worked. In fact,
capitalism has prepared or is preparing the mechanism
<span class='pageno' title='357' id='Page_357'></span>
by which it may be superseded. It has done its work
so thoroughly that it has been rendering even itself
superfluous. We need not add that preparatory steps
towards the transformation of the company may also
be seen in the spread of the principle of industrial
partnerships or profit-sharing. In America, where the
industrial development is more recent, the founders of
the great corporations still to a large degree continue to
control them. Yet we can see how the constructive
talent they have so marvellously shown has paved the
way for social control when the time may come for it.</p>

<p>6. But the greatest force in the social evolution of
the present time consists of the human beings who are
most directly interested in it—the modern democracy.
This democracy is marked by a combination of characteristics
which are new to history. It is being
educated and enlightened in the school and by the
cheap press; it is being drilled and organised in large
factories, in the national armies, by vast popular
demonstrations, in the gigantic electoral struggles of
the time. Thus it is becoming conscious of its
enormous power, and able to make use of it. It is
becoming conscious also of its unsatisfactory social
and economic position. The democracy which is
growing to be the master-force of the civilised world
is still for the most part economically a proletariat
dependent on precarious wage-labour. While they are
resolved to proceed with the consummation of the
political change which is involved in the establishment
of democracy, their goal is an economic
<span class='pageno' title='358' id='Page_358'></span>
transformation. But the inevitable process of concentration
of industrial operations already referred to
is entirely against the continuance or restoration of the
small producer, whether workman or peasant proprietor.
Such efforts of continuance or restoration are
reactionary: they are economically unsound and must
fail. The economic transformation must be sought in
the application of the principle of association to the
large industry.</p>

<p>7. We are thus brought to the conclusion that the
competitive system, with precarious wage-labour as the
lot of the vast majority of the people, is not a suitable
and adequate form for the social development of the
future. The competitive system has led to great
strikes, which have been the cause of widespread
misery, almost as grievous as the suffering endured
during the worst campaigns under the old style of warfare.
It has led to great commercial and industrial
crises, which have scattered over the civilised world
panic and ruin, followed by long-continued stagnation
and depression. Thus anarchy, waste, and starvation
have been its too frequent attendants, while the normal
position of the workmen under it has been precarious
and unworthy of free, enlightened men. England has
had less reason than most countries to regret the prevalence
of competition, for her industrial supremacy
has generally left her victor in the struggle, and she
has hitherto looked forward to widening markets as the
solution of her economic troubles. But the rapid
development of Germany and America may teach us
<span class='pageno' title='359' id='Page_359'></span>
that our industrial position is not so secure against
assault as it used to be, and that we may in future
suffer the bitter experience of the vanquished, which
we have so long inflicted on others. And we may
thus learn that reason and law should control industry
and commerce as well as other spheres of
human activity.</p>

<p>In America the development of the trust system
is only another proof of the inadequacy of the competitive
system. The supporters of the trusts maintain
with very good show of reason that unregulated
competition is harmful and may be ruinous to all
concerned, and that they can maintain fair prices, pay
fair wages, and secure a fair return to capital only by
mutual arrangement among the producers. But the
system obviously involves the serious objection, that
the great industrial chiefs who organise and direct the
trusts are thereby constituted supreme judges of their
own interests and of the economic interests of the
whole American people; that such combinations form
a huge monopoly in so many of the leading articles
of consumption, and establish an economic, social, and
political power which may be a danger to American
society. In short, we are driven to the result that
while competition has been hurtful or ruinous to those
engaged in it, the now prevailing system of regulation
by capitalism in its own interests is a serious danger
to the whole people. There is only one right way out
of such a dilemma. A return to the competitive
method is neither possible nor desirable. Monopoly
<span class='pageno' title='360' id='Page_360'></span>
is incompatible with freedom. The only course
for peoples who desire to be free is to adopt some
form of social ownership and control. This appears
to be the lesson taught us by the development of the
trusts.</p>

<p>8. The success of socialism greatly depends on the
realisation of the two ideals, which may be regarded as
the main pillars of the theory, when applied to practice.
These are:—</p>

<p>(<span class='it'>a</span>) The normal working day: the general reduction
of the working day to eight hours in the immediate
future, and eventually to a shorter time. Such a
desirable change would be better accomplished by
voluntary agreement under the pressure of public
opinion than by legislation; but it would be better
made by legislation than by the cruel and clumsy
method of strikes.</p>

<p>(<span class='it'>b</span>) A remuneration which will ensure a suitable
standard of living; in other words, the means of a
normal development. A reasonable standard of living,
the competent means of a normal development have
been determined by science and are no longer a matter
of utopian guess-work. A fairly definite measure of
fresh air, food, clothing, house comfort, recreation, and
of satisfaction for the affections associated with wife and
children constitute the rational needs of the average
man. This is the moral and scientific basis of a
rational system of distribution. The competitive wage
determined by the <span class='it'>iron law of wages</span> of the older
economists should be superseded by a remuneration
<span class='pageno' title='361' id='Page_361'></span>
embodying this principle. It is the Daily Bread of the
Lord’s Prayer as definable by modern science.</p>

<p>The effect of the socialistic theory on these points is
to remove two vital interests of man from the range of
competition, and to place them on an ethical and
scientific basis under social control. In so far as the
working day of the employees of government, municipalities,
co-operative societies, companies, and private
firms approximates to eight hours, in so far as the wage
paid by them secures to the workers a fit and reasonable
standard of living, in so far is the socialistic ideal
realised. Every one conversant with the history of the
last sixty years knows how vast an improvement has
been made in both respects.</p>

<p>We have thus reviewed the great social and economic
movements of our time. How shall we interpret them?
There are two main tendencies: one towards control of
the economic processes by the people in state, municipality,
and co-operative society; the other towards the
consolidation of capitalism in trusts. In both we see
plan, constructive and organising intelligence, the limitation
of the anarchy of competition. But while the
former makes for the public good, the latter is subservient
to overgrown wealth.</p>

<p>The portentous growth of the trusts is indeed an
object-lesson to the world. It proves that socialism is
not an idle question; nor is it utopian or revolutionary
merely. It is a question forced upon the present
generation by the most gigantic industrial movement of
recent times. All good citizens, all friends of righteousness
<span class='pageno' title='362' id='Page_362'></span>
and of progress, all inquirers worthy of the name,
are under an imperative obligation to understand the
true inwardness of the subject.</p>

<p>In considering the question of the practicability of a
rational socialism, let us remember that it only proposes
to accomplish on a wider scale and for a more enlightened
time a task analogous to that undertaken by the
guilds for the mediæval world. The guild was an
organisation for the promotion of the common interests
of the workers at a time when law and order were not
sufficiently established by strong central governments,
and when the present distinction between labourer and
capitalist had not declared itself. It was a fairly
equitable organisation of an industry which was local
and associated with city life, and which worked with a
very limited and undeveloped technique. Socialism
proposes an equitable organisation of industry for the
modern world with its enormous mechanical development
and large industry, under a democracy guided by
science and professing allegiance to the highest moral
ideals.</p>

<p><span class='pageno' title='363' id='Page_363'></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV<br/><br/>THE PREVALENT SOCIALISM</h2>

<p>In the Erfurt Programme we have seen that the task of
the social democracy is to give form and unity to the
struggle of the working class, and to point out its
natural and necessary goal. This goal is the transformation
of private property in the means of production
into collective property, but the change will be
accomplished not in the interest of a class but of the
entire human race. The Erfurt Programme has been
followed by others of a like nature in Belgium, Austria,
France, and elsewhere. It may be regarded as the aim
of the social democracy of all countries to obtain possession
of political power in order to make the economic
transformation which we have indicated.</p>

<p>A like aim has been set forth in the resolutions
passed at International Congresses. In a previous
chapter we have seen that International Congresses
were held at Paris in 1889, at Brussels in 1891, at
Zürich in 1893, and at London in 1896. These were
followed by Congresses, at Paris for a second time in
1900, at Amsterdam in 1904, and at Stuttgart in 1907.</p>

<p>The disorders which prevailed at the Congresses
<span class='pageno' title='364' id='Page_364'></span>
of Brussels and London led to the adoption of measures
for the better ordering of business and for the better
organisation of the Congresses, ‘destined to become
the parliament of the proletariat.’ We shall now give
a brief statement of the new measures, which date in
a general way from the Paris Congress of 1900.</p>

<p>As to terms of admission. All associations are
admitted which adhere to the essential principles of
socialism: socialisation of the means of production and
exchange; international union and action of the workers;
socialist conquest of political power by the proletariat
organised as a class party. Also all the trade organisations
which place themselves on the basis of the class
struggle and recognise the necessity of political action,
legislative and parliamentary. Anarchists are therefore
excluded.</p>

<p>An International Socialist Bureau having its seat
at Brussels has been established. It consists of two
delegates from each country and has a permanent
secretary. Among other functions the Bureau and its
secretary have to organise the International Congresses
and to arrange the order of business at them.</p>

<p>At former Congresses much time was spent in
hearing verbal reports, in French, English, and German,
of the progress of socialism in the various countries.
The Bureau now invites and receives from the various
national bodies reports, which are printed and laid
before the Congress. These reports form a most
valuable storehouse of information with regard to the
development of socialism throughout the world.
<span class='pageno' title='365' id='Page_365'></span></p>

<p>The result of those measures was manifest at the
Stuttgart Congress, where the business proceeded with
dispatch and in comparative order. Delegates to
the number of 886 were assembled from twenty-six
nationalities, and discussed matters of importance
relating to the international social movement. The
revival of the International could be regarded as an
accomplished fact. But it was a revival in a new form
and under conditions which had undergone a marvellous
change. The old International has been compared by
Vandervelde to a brilliant general staff without an
army. In many countries the socialist cause had
hardly begun to move; in no country had it attained
to any real strength. Now socialism had powerful
and well-organised parties in most of the leading
countries of Europe, and it counted its adherents by
millions.</p>

<p>The Bureau at Brussels does not perform the functions
of the general council of the old International.
It has no commanding mind and will, like that of Karl
Marx, to supply initiative and energy. It serves as
a connecting link between the national parties; it
tends to co-ordinate theories, tactics, and action.
But the vitality and moving force of the new International
are found in the different national groups.</p>

<p>We may say, then, that the new International only
in a limited measure realises the thought of Marx.
The idea of using political power as an instrument
of social amelioration originated with the Chartists
and L. Blanc. Marx in the communist manifesto
<span class='pageno' title='366' id='Page_366'></span>
first made it international and revolutionary, and he
claimed also to have made it scientific. It was scientific
in so far as it was a reasoned and comprehensive
expression of real forces. In the International as we
now have it we may perceive an organisation of the
real forces which Marx had the insight to foresee and
enjoin.</p>

<p>A long series of resolutions have been passed by
the various Congresses which have met since 1889.
If we take those resolutions along with the elaborate
programmes that have been formulated by the
various national parties, and of which the Erfurt
programme may be regarded as the type, we have a
set of documents which may undoubtedly be considered
official and authoritative. Both resolutions and programmes
are the result of a long labour of thought and
debate by their best minds. They agree generally in
their exposition of principles and tactics. We may,
therefore, have no doubt that they contain a reliable
statement of the prevalent socialism. We give an
abstract of the most important points on which socialists
of all lands agree:—</p>

<p>(1) The goal of the whole movement is an economic
revolution or transformation—the transference to
society of the means of production, distribution, and
exchange.</p>

<p>(2) The conquest of political power by the organised
action of the working class of all lands is the chief
means towards this great end.</p>

<p>(3) The great task of the socialist parties at present
<span class='pageno' title='367' id='Page_367'></span>
is education, agitation, and organisation in the widest
sense, with a view to the physical and moral regeneration
of the working class, so as to fit it for its great
mission. To rouse the class consciousness of the
workers, to increase their capacity and efficiency for
the class struggle, is the daily task of international
socialism.</p>

<p>(4) The struggle for equal and direct universal
suffrage, for the popular initiative and referendum,
is an important phase of the political struggle, and
is fitted to have a good influence on the political
education of the workers.</p>

<p>(5) The more purely political struggle of the
Socialist Parties should go hand in hand with the more
purely economic struggle of the trade unions.</p>

<p>(6) The right of association, of combination, of free
meeting, of free speech, and of a free press, is an essential
part of the worker’s claim of rights.</p>

<p>(7) The demonstration of the 1st of May is specially
recommended in all countries as a means of securing
an eight-hours’ working day. The eight-hours’ day
is most desirable for improving the family life, the
education, the health, energy, intelligence, and morality
of the working class.</p>

<p>(8) But the eight-hours’ day is only the most urgent
part of a large system of protective legislation in favour
of the working class. Besides an eight-hours’ day for
adults, they demand special legislation for children,
young people, and women; proper rest for all ages;
restriction of night work; abolition of the sweating
<span class='pageno' title='368' id='Page_368'></span>
system; effective inspection of factories, shops, and of
domestic labour, as well as of agriculture.</p>

<p>(9) They are very strongly opposed to militarism,
which they consider due not so much to national or
political differences, as to the struggle of the capitalist
classes for new markets. They believe that war will
end only with the ending of capitalism. The present
standing armies are the instruments of the ruling and
exploiting class, and should be abolished. Their place
should be taken by a citizen army or the armed nation;
that is, the entire able-bodied manhood of the people
should be trained and equipped on a democratic basis,
like the Swiss army. The Socialist Parties of the
various countries are recommended to vote against expenditure
for existing army and navy.</p>

<p>(10) The majority at Congresses has without reserve
condemned the colonial system as being merely an
extension of the field of exploitation of the capitalist
class. But this majority has consisted mainly of
nations that have little knowledge of colonies and little
interest in them. It has ignored the colonial system
of England, which has so largely consisted in the
development of self-governing communities; and it has
also ignored or misunderstood the beneficent work of
England in establishing conditions of peace, order, and
progress in India. The colonial system as understood
by the majority simply means the exploitation of native
and coloured races for the profit of the capitalist class.
A large minority, while condemning the present colonial
policy, think that it might be made beneficial.
<span class='pageno' title='369' id='Page_369'></span></p>

<p>The goal of the whole movement is collectivism;
but little or nothing is said as to the forms it will take
or how it will be realised. That task is left to the
future. On the other hand, much is said of the means
by which political power may be gained. Among
these we should observe that the two points which are
most essential, and may be regarded as the key of the
whole position, are universal suffrage and the right of
combination, the former being necessary for the purely
political development of socialism, the latter for the
development of labour in trade unions. For these two
rights socialism and labour are prepared to put forth
the greatest efforts and to make the greatest sacrifices.
For them the orderly and well-disciplined Social
Democracy of Germany is ready to adopt in the last
resort the drastic measure of the general strike.<a id='r1_16'/><a href='#f1_16' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a>
Demonstrations in favour of universal suffrage have
been frequent events during recent years in many
European countries. The Russian Socialist Revolutionary
Party has declared itself ready to accept as
a field of agitation a constituent assembly elected
on a thoroughly democratic basis and embodying the
sovereign will of the people.</p>

<p>The rights of the trade union have quite recently
been a supreme interest to the Labour Party in Great
Britain. And in America the use of the ‘injunctions’
to hinder the development of labour combinations has
been a chief grievance among the workmen. This
grievance took a foremost place in the discussion of
<span class='pageno' title='370' id='Page_370'></span>
matters which went to form the platforms of candidates
at the Presidential election of 1908. Universal
suffrage and the right of combination, with all that
these two great rights involve, may be regarded as the
central points in the present tactics and policy of international
socialism.</p>

<p>The other points in the above statement may here
be left to speak for themselves. But if we note that
the most deeply resented grievance of the workmen is
the use of the police and the military by the executives
of various countries to repress agitation, we shall the
better understand many incidents of recent history in
Italy, Russia, and even America.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the task which lies before the
social democracy is a vast one. As yet even the
political part of it is only to a small extent realised.
At present the working class, though forming the vast
majority of the people, has no corresponding representation
in legislatures or influence in government. In
England the ruling class has long been, and still is, an
aristocracy, slowly changing in the course of generations
into a plutocracy which has the wisdom to yield
to the ever-growing pressure of democracy. France is
now nearer to a real democracy than any other great
European state. In Germany the executive depends
on the Emperor; but his Chancellor has to find a
majority for legislation and for the budgets in the
Reichstag, which is elected by universal suffrage with
an antiquated distribution of seats. The German
executive is really a bureaucracy with the Emperor as
<span class='pageno' title='371' id='Page_371'></span>
chief. Government in Austria and Russia is also a
bureaucracy of which the Emperor is the head. In
Italy the democracy is slowly growing. It has very
little real influence in Spain.</p>

<p>If the American people do not exert themselves very
effectively in the immediate future, the Republic seems
destined to be a plutocracy. A power which appears to
be incompatible with a real commonwealth has arisen
in a marvellously short time. The oil industry in
America goes back only to 1859. Mr. J. D. Rockefeller
entered the trade in 1865. It was organised by him
and his associates into the Standard Oil Company;
and the Company has been the type of further organisation,
has provided the men, the methods, and the capital,
by which other great industries have been transformed.
That is to say, Mr. J. D. Rockefeller and the men trained
in his methods have gained control of railways, of
finance and insurance, and even of the basic industries
of steel and coal. The process has naturally gained
enormously in momentum as it has gone on; the
capital accumulated, and still more the capital controlled
by the Trusts, the interests they have absorbed or
brought within their orbit are gigantic, and continually
increasing. Even the American Senate is declared to
be in their pay. Most evil of all symptoms, when
an eminent American senator, Mr. Tillman, lately
undertook to speak for his order, a main point in his
defence was, that the House of Representatives was
worse than the Senate! Thus we see the industrial
and economic power, which is also the money power,
<span class='pageno' title='372' id='Page_372'></span>
subordinating to itself the political, and, indeed,
threatening all that is articulate and organic in the
American people. In 1908, at the Chicago Convention,
Senator Lodge went to the heart of the matter: ‘It is
the huge size of private fortunes and the vast extent
of the power of modern combinations of capital which
have brought upon us in these later years problems
portentous in their possibilities, and threatening not
only our social and political welfare, but even our
personal freedom if they are not boldly met and wisely
solved.’</p>

<p>Warnings have been given by some observers, including
the present writer, that such a condition of things
was coming. In my <span class='it'>Inquiry into Socialism</span>, published
in 1887, I said: ‘In crossing the ocean the colonists
left behind them the monarchy and aristocracy, and
many other social forms hoary with venerable abuse;
but they carried with them an institution older and more
fundamental than royalty or a hereditary legislature—human
nature itself.’ The old evils of Europe grew
out of human nature. On the other side of the Atlantic
men will still be human. ‘Freedom in America seems
threatened by the domination of great corporations,
combining to obtain the control of industrial operations,
of governments, and courts of justice. If unchecked
by the healthy public opinion, and by the collective
will of the American people, such corporations may
establish an economic, social, and political tyranny
quite as oppressive as anything existing in Europe.
It will be a miserable thing for the world if triumphant
<span class='pageno' title='373' id='Page_373'></span>
democracy, and a material prosperity unexampled in
the annals of mankind, end in a fiasco such as this.’<a id='r2_16'/><a href='#f2_16' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>The struggle to curb the corporations and bring
them within the limits prescribed by the public good
will not be an easy one. Waves of popular enthusiasm
are apt to be fitful and transient, whilst the pull of
organised wealth is steady, continuous, incessant. The
favourite rhetorical figure of the octopus spreading its
gigantic tentacles over American society gives but a
faint impression of the subtle and insidious activity of
the Trusts. Even in Russia the problem is a simple one
compared with that in America; the contest with the
Tzardom is merely one of force striving against
force by all available means. Vastly simpler was the
earliest struggle of historic civilisation, when the Greeks
met the clumsy hosts of Persia. The Americans may
consider themselves as the foremost champions, at the
most critical point, in the most momentous struggle now
going forward on the planet.</p>

<p><span class='it'>Noblesse oblige</span> was the maxim of a caste that is
vanishing. It is still an imperative call on all truly
noble men and nations. The American colonies were
founded by the noblest pioneers of freedom, from the
best and strongest races of Europe. Such a high
ancestry lays men under a special obligation to acquit
themselves well in the warfare against organised wealth.
One of the main causes of the present situation is that
in the eager race for wealth or for a living the Americans
have had no leisure to be good citizens, in the sense
<span class='pageno' title='374' id='Page_374'></span>
contemplated by the founders of the Republic. They
have left their own proper civic work to professional
politicians. In the combination of professional politicians
ready to be bought and of wealthy capitalists
ready to buy lies the supreme danger to American
freedom. The danger will be averted when the people
take care duly to think the matter out, and to enter
upon a course of resolute organised action suitable to
the time and its needs.</p>

<p>One of the first duties of the people will obviously
be to simplify the cumbrous machinery of the Constitution,
and to make it a more efficient organ of their will.
In the two great crises of American history, nothing
strikes us so forcibly as the high standard of character
and intelligence which was shown. It may be regarded
as a symptom of a really strong race, that they were
so slow and reluctant to take decisive measures in the
struggle for Independence and at the time of the Civil
War. We may now see the same natural hesitation in
deciding how to handle a problem of surpassing gravity.
Such crises are the severest and truest tests of national
character. All friends of freedom in every part of the
world will fervently hope that the people of America
may display their historic qualities of insight, high
principle, energy, and resolution in the mighty struggle
of Commonwealth against Wealth upon which they are
entering.</p>

<p>According to Liebknecht, late leader of the German
socialists, ‘the social democracy is the party of the
whole people, except 200,000 large proprietors, squires,
<span class='pageno' title='375' id='Page_375'></span>
middle-class capitalists, and priests.’ We need not
discuss the exactitude of such figures in relation either
to Germany or any other country. It is a fact which
no reasonable man can dispute that economic and
political power is in most civilised countries actually
wielded by a very small minority. Nor need we stay
here to inquire into the methods by which such power
has been gained. Even as regards England we have not
yet an impartial and comprehensive account of the rise
of the present economic and political order since the
liquidation of the mediæval system began about the
middle of the fourteenth century. How labour legislation
was carried on by the ruling class in its own
interests for five centuries after 1349; how Henry VIII.
took his courtiers and privy councillors into partnership
for the dividing of the church lands; how commons
were inclosed; how even the poor-law became an
occasion for the subjection and degradation of labour;
how for generations bribery was a normal instrument
of government; how wealth was gained in the slave-trade,
in the East Indies, in the jobbing of government
loans and contracts, and by the imposition of corn-laws—all
these we vaguely know, but they have not yet been
presented in a form which can satisfy the canons of
scientific history.</p>

<p>It is too soon, therefore, to determine how far the
business of the Standard Oil Company has been built
up on its merits; how far its success is due to efficient
management and organisation by the shrewdest and
ablest men, and how far due to the illegal and immoral
<span class='pageno' title='376' id='Page_376'></span>
methods of which they are accused. At the Chicago
Convention in 1908 Senator Lodge said that the great
body of the people had come to believe more and more
that these vast fortunes, these vast combinations of
capital, were formed and built up by tortuous and
dishonest means and with a cynical disregard of the
very laws which the mass of the people were compelled
to obey. On the other hand the <span class='it'>Reminiscences</span> of
Mr. Rockefeller reveal a rare combination of insight and
energy in founding and consolidating a new industry
which of itself is sufficient to account for success.
In any case, we in England, looking back on our
history, have no right to point the finger of reproach at
our American kinsmen. There is indeed a cynical
theory that our ruling classes are free from such
reproach only because they have been sated with the
wealth they have already gained. With us the struggle
has long been decided; whereas in America the dust
and heat of battle still blind the eyes of men.</p>

<p>The motives and merits of the agents by which
great historic changes are accomplished, whether they
be Julius Cæsar, Henry VIII., or J. D. Rockefeller, form
a most interesting and important subject of study.
But far more important is the problem we must face
regarding the forces and the issues which they set in
movement. Here we are concerned with live forces and
urgent issues.</p>

<p>Briefly we may describe the situation with which
we have to deal as the struggle now proceeding between
various forms of autocracy, bureaucracy, and plutocracy,
<span class='pageno' title='377' id='Page_377'></span>
on the one hand, and a social democracy which claims
to represent the mass of the people, on the other. The
features of the former powers we all know. The social
democracy is still in its giant and untried youth. Not
very long ago, as we have seen, the German working
men had neither voice nor organisation nor insight into
their position and prospects. France, after the failures
of 1848, was hardly better. In most countries labour
was dumb, or moaning under its burden of hardship
and sorrow. Now much is changed. The working men
have the foremost orators in the world to speak with
their enemies in the gate, and they have an organisation
which the strongest statesmen have been unable to
break up or weaken. In previous chapters we have
had frequent occasion to characterise the democracy of
which the workers are the vast majority. We shall
understand it better if we duly consider a few special
points.</p>

<p>On the 28th November 1905 the city of Vienna saw
a new sight. The gay city on the Danube has been the
scene of many stirring events. It was twice in vain
besieged by the Turks, and twice taken by Napoleon.
It was the seat of two congresses which met to rearrange
the map of Europe after the downfall of the French
conqueror. It witnessed many of the most dramatic
incidents of the mad year (<span class='it'>des tollen jahres</span>)—the year
of revolution, 1848.</p>

<p>To those who can see beneath the surface of things,
the scene of November 1905 was vastly more significant
than any of the events we have mentioned. A procession
<span class='pageno' title='378' id='Page_378'></span>
of working men and women, estimated by
the correspondent of the <span class='it'>Morning Post</span> at 300,000, and
by socialist organs at 250,000, marched under the red
flag through the streets. Work ceased and traffic was
stopped, while the serried ranks passed on. But there
was no tumult, no call for the interference of the
police or the display of military force. Not a shout
was raised or song sung or voice heard above a whisper.
The silence, order, and discipline shown by this vast
host, which was about equal to either of the great armies
that lately contended in Manchuria, were even more
striking than its numbers. Members of parliament
who witnessed the demonstration from the Reichsrath
declared that they were more impressed by it than by
any political event since Austria became a parliamentary
state. Even the most stubborn adherent of
the old order was bound to feel that a new era had
come, and that the demand for universal suffrage, which
was the object of the demonstration, could no longer be
refused. That very day legislation based on universal
suffrage was announced by the government.</p>

<p>The great demonstration was, indeed, a fit subject
for meditation in Austria, but not in that country only.
The monition contained in such an event should be
taken to heart by all concerned in all lands. In the
ordering and organising intelligence, in the self-restraint
and force of character displayed by the working men
of Vienna on that day, we see qualities which are
replete with meaning in their relation to the great
problems of the present century.
<span class='pageno' title='379' id='Page_379'></span></p>

<p>Or let us consider the matter from another point of
view. It is now about half a century since the socialist
agitation began in Germany. During that time the
German workmen have received an education in social
politics such as no university in the world can furnish.
They have been accustomed to the freest and most
thorough discussion of the widest variety of topics in
books and pamphlets, at public meetings and debates,
in private talks over their beer and coffee. Great
strikes, elections, and demonstrations have been object-lessons
to them of the most vivid and forcible description.
A new move on the part of the Kaiser, a new speech of
Bebel or Liebknecht has given fresh food for reflection
and discourse. Above all, the matters so handled have
come near to their hearts, have touched them in their
everyday life in the closest and most real way. They
were no hearsay, conventional, or traditional subjects
that thus appealed to them! Need we wonder that
the teaching of Marx, Lassalle, and Engels has become
a possession to them, a theme for mind and heart? The
seed has taken root among millions of men and
women remarkable for intelligence, thoroughness, and
earnestness. And the process that has thus gone on
in Germany goes on more or less all over the world.</p>

<p>The men and women of the labouring democracy, let
us remember, have, many of them, known hunger and
privation in every form, not only as an exceptionally
severe occurrence in times of strike and unemployment,
but as a chronic experience. Mothers have been obliged
to work hard too long before child-bearing, and too soon
<span class='pageno' title='380' id='Page_380'></span>
after it, to eke out a scanty family income. For a
society that has shown so little respect even for the
sacred function of motherhood, what can we say but
that it is time to repent? The children in the same
competitive society have cried for bread when there
was none to give them, and have not had rags enough
decently to cover their nakedness.</p>

<p>In a moment of feeling at the Jena meeting of his
party Bebel confessed that for years it was his ideal for
once to eat his fill of bread and butter. During the
sieges of Kimberley and Mafeking our countrymen had
a new experience; they found out what it meant never
to have enough to eat, to be always hungry. The
leader of one of the strongest organisations in the world,
one of the foremost orators in Europe, to whom all men
listen when he makes a speech, had the experience for
years in the very heart of modern civilisation.</p>

<p>The same children who were thus early acquainted
with hunger have gone to be racked at the mill of
labour before they were eight, or even six years of age.
We need not wonder that they were stunted and
dwarfed in growth, that they were wrinkled, deformed,
attenuated, grey, and decrepit before their time; and
they have suffered all this hunger and privation through
a long agony of years, they and their fathers and
mothers before them, while the classes which have
held economic and political power have wasted the
means so much needed for worthier uses in war and in
the preparation for war, in the luxury and extravagance
of society and of courts.
<span class='pageno' title='381' id='Page_381'></span></p>

<p>Nor has this condition of rags, hunger, and privation
come to an end. We may see it in the course of a
casual walk in almost any quarter of any of the towns
of Great Britain to-day.</p>

<p>In many countries the democracy assumes a more
serious and a menacing form. Among the trade unions
of France there is a pronounced distrust in the efficacy
of parliamentary action and a predilection for more
direct and energetic methods. We see a like tendency
in a stronger form in Italy. The new Italy has
endeavoured to play a rôle as a great military and
naval power, for which she was hardly fitted by her
natural resources or her economic development. A
large majority of her people suffer all the miseries
that flow from extreme ignorance, poverty, and degradation.
Strikes, riots, and other tumultuary outbreaks
have been put down by the police and the soldiers
with a rough hand. The misery of the people of
Italy finds expression in a very large emigration. In
a single year as many as 270,000 go abroad, chiefly to
the countries of Central Europe, for a period of six
months, while 350,000 leave the country as permanent
emigrants, chiefly to America. We must regard them
as driven by poverty and hunger rather than impelled
by the spirit of enterprise.</p>

<p>But the most active revolutionary centre of Europe
has now shifted eastwards. In Russia the development
of modern methods of industry has only added to the
depth and intensity of the struggle. Great capitalists
have joined the great landlords in giving support to
<span class='pageno' title='382' id='Page_382'></span>
the Czardom and the bureaucracy in the mighty conflict
with the growing revolutionary parties which represent
rural and town workers. It has been an appalling
struggle, in which the oldest forms of rule have contended
with the newest forces of change. What
the end may be no man can foresee. So long as the
Czardom receives adequate support from the military
forces it may continue to survive, but the course of the
revolution has shown that the loyalty of army and fleet
has been seriously shaken. The Socialist Revolutionary
Party contemplate a victory of the working class led
by them, and in case of necessity the provisional
establishment of its revolutionary dictatorship. But
we may fear that the anarchy which might ensue on
the overthrow of the Czardom might lead to the
supremacy of a military chief. In either case the
danger to the neighbouring countries, and especially to
South-Eastern Europe, already distracted by racial
differences, is only too obvious.</p>

<p>In a well-informed article on the rising of the
Roumanian peasantry in 1907 the <span class='it'>Spectator</span> said that
their cause was the cause of a hundred million of
peasantry in Eastern Europe. The remark was a true
one. The revolt of labour in Russia is for the most part
a rising of peasants for ‘land and liberty.’ It has been
a rising full of terror, of omen, and of warning to all who
undertake the rule and guidance of men. In Eastern
Europe Enceladus has risen. Long buried under heavy
mountain loads of privation, of oppression, and of neglect
even worse than oppression, he has risen to claim his
<span class='pageno' title='383' id='Page_383'></span>
rights. If well guided he might have been a kindly and
beneficent giant, for the Russian peasant is essentially
good-humoured and well-disposed. But the powers that
be have contented themselves with the exaction of recruits
and taxes, of labour and rent. They have otherwise done
nothing for him, and have given him no scope for doing
anything for himself. With little light or guidance, too
frequently suffering the worst privations of cold and
famine, and goaded by the sense of immemorial wrong,
he could not be expected to resist the fiery draughts from
the winepress of the revolution, and he committed such
excesses as we know! The Czardom and its servants
have prevailed. The giant has been driven back to his
prison. He is neither dead nor asleep, but lies moaning
and restless on his bed of pain. He will rise again!</p>

<p>The Socialist Revolutionary Party declare that it is
from no love for sanguinary methods that they have taken
up arms. It was their stern duty before the revolution,
before the cause of the workers. It was a decision serious
and full of responsibility. The party ‘will not cease to
employ terrorist tactics in the political struggle till the
establishment of institutions which will make the will
of the people the source of power and of legislation.’</p>

<p>Its task has been to lead the masses of the people
in revolt, and it has done so with a resolution and self-sacrifice
seldom equalled in history. Its members
have been ready to kill and to be killed. There can
be no doubt that the revolutionary feeling in Russia
has increased enormously in depth and width since the
days of Alexander II. The composition of the second
<span class='pageno' title='384' id='Page_384'></span>
Duma, which was probably the most revolutionary
assembly that has ever met on this planet, was a proof
and symptom of the extent to which the spirit of
revolt had spread. Out of 500 members 200 belonged
to the left, and of these 60 were social democrats,
40 socialist revolutionaries, 15 populist socialists, and
60 were labour men, the small remainder being independent
radicals. But the same spirit of revolution
has pervaded rural and town workers, has
penetrated to fleet and army, to the teachers and the
intellectual classes. We may be assured that the
drama of the revolution is not ended. The revolution
has been spreading among a population of 135,000,000
having racial affinities with numerous peoples in
Central and South-Eastern Europe. The Ukase of
November 1906, which gave the right to every member
of a village community to claim complete possession of
his present allotment as permanent private property,
will, so far as it is operative, tend greatly to aggravate the
unrest. It will disintegrate the village community, break
up old forms of life, give more power to the village usurer,
and in many ways add to the violence of the revolutionary
forces. Enceladus will rise again, with results
to Russia and to Europe that no man can forecast.</p>

<p>The division into two nations of Rich and Poor,
which the Earl of Beaconsfield described in his novel,
<span class='it'>Sybil</span>, as existing in England, has become international.
A chasm more or less wide and abrupt extends
throughout the civilised world. Even Japan now has
an active socialist party, and when the industrial
<span class='pageno' title='385' id='Page_385'></span>
revolution has fairly begun to run its course in China
we may expect to see its people among the foremost
in the social revolution. The real economic and
political power still lies in the hands of a small
minority, while over against it stands the democracy
composed of workers who are every day advancing
in intelligence, in organisation, and in the resolute
endeavour towards a common goal. Wealth, power,
and enjoyment go together. Labour is attended by
poverty and privation.</p>

<p>A great struggle is going on, and there can be no
doubt that it will go on. How is it to be fought
out? This is the supreme question which the
twentieth century must try to solve.</p>

<p>It is of unspeakable importance that it should take
a wise and peaceful course. In all countries which
have a genuine system of universal suffrage fairly
carried out, a peaceful solution is practicable. But for
such a peaceful solution it will be necessary that all
autocratic and bureaucratic government should cease,
and that an executive, not only formally responsible to
the people but really responsive to their wishes,
and in close touch with them, should be established.
Such a government could accomplish a beneficent
social and economic transformation without violence,
without spoliation or confiscation, without even giving
an undue shock to the reasonable claims and habits
of any section of the people. This might be effected
by a truly democratic government, or by the steady
pressure of the democracy on the old governments,
<span class='pageno' title='386' id='Page_386'></span>
which would be gradually changed. So much for the
peaceful transformation of the State.</p>

<p>May we not also expect that socialists will take a
more serious and enlightened view of their responsibilities
in aspiring to lead organised labour, and may
we not in the course of time hope for a modification
of their aims and methods? If these were more reasonable,
they would obviously be more convincing, and
the prospects of a peaceful as well as a successful issue
would be vastly increased. At present their demands
are often so put in elaborate programmes, in language
more or less technical, that they repel the sympathy
even of reasonable men. To use a common saying,
socialism as frequently presented is such ‘a big order,’
expressed in alien language, that men with the best
will in the world cannot give it a hospitable welcome
to their minds.</p>

<p>In fact, it is not a paradox but the plain truth that
socialists are now the greatest obstacle to the progress
of their ideal. Nor is this at all strange. The same
thing has happened in the development of all great
ideals; men are too little for them, and in their love
for forms and dogmas forget and even repudiate or
suppress the spirit. For the progress of socialism the
thing most needful now is to throw off the technical
dogmatic and ultra-revolutionary form which it has
inherited from the past, and to study the real needs
and live issues of the present.</p>

<p>Socialism is still coloured to its detriment by
excessive loyalty to Marx, and the views of Marx were
<span class='pageno' title='387' id='Page_387'></span>
shaped by a time which has passed away. In
the early forties, when the system of Marx was
taking form, idealism had declined, and a very crude
dogmatic materialism was in the ascendant. The
very active speculation which had previously been
directed to the ideal, attempted to work in the
real and material without due preparation on a very
inadequate basis of facts—with strange results! A fierce
militant revolutionary spirit, which in the circumstances
must be regarded as very natural, was preparing for the
troubles of 1848. Ricardo, a man singularly deficient
in the requisite historical and philosophical training,
was the reigning power in economic theory. Under
such influences the views of Marx were prematurely
shaped into the dogmatic system which we know. He
continued to hold and develop them without any real
attempt at self-criticism in riper years, and he, an exile
living in England, forcibly urged them from his study
on the socialist groups and parties of the Continent.</p>

<p>In his manifesto of the Communist party, Marx
declares that the proletariat has nothing to lose but its
chains. It has been the unfortunate destiny of him
and his school to forge new chains for the working class
in the shape of dogmatic materialism, a rigid and
abstract collectivism, and ultra-revolutionary views,
which still hamper it in the task of emancipation. The
promptitude with which the emancipators of the human
race have provided new chains is strange enough. Still
stranger is the readiness men have shown in putting
them on! As we have seen in a previous chapter, the
<span class='pageno' title='388' id='Page_388'></span>
followers of Marx have gone further in this way than
their chief.<a id='r3_16'/><a href='#f3_16' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>An ill service was done to the working class by
utterances on marriage and the family, which gave the
ruling classes who keep the workers out of their rights
the plea that they were maintaining the fundamental
principles of social order. The abstract collectivism
which is the prominent economic feature of his school
suggests two serious doubts: if by a revolutionary act
they took the delicate and complex social mechanism
to pieces, whether they would be able to put it together
again; and if they did succeed in putting it together,
whether it would work. The same devotion to abstract
collectivism has made his followers unable to draw up
a reasonable agrarian policy suitable to the peasantry.
Their hostility to religion, expressed most freely in the
early years of the agitation in Germany and elsewhere,
has been a serious hindrance to their progress, both
among Catholics and Protestants, especially the
former.</p>

<p>Thus in many directions their propaganda has been
an obstacle to their success in their proper task of
emancipating the working class, and it has at the same
time been a hindrance to the peaceful solution of the
great struggle. The great central problem has been
confused by side issues and irrelevant matter. We can
best show how tragic has been the confusion of parts
and of issues by reference to religion. Love, brotherhood,
mutual service, and peace are most prominent
<span class='pageno' title='389' id='Page_389'></span>
notes in the teaching of Jesus. They must be woven
into the moral texture of socialism if it is to succeed
and be a benefit to the world. If Marx and his
school had merely attacked what we may call the
official and professional representatives of the Christian
Church, they would have been within their rights.
As it has been, the religion of love, brotherhood, and
mutual service has officially become part of a government
system by which the hereditary oppressors of the
poor in Germany and elsewhere claim to continue their
unblest work. The professional representatives of
Christ’s teaching support and encourage them in it, and
so make themselves accomplices, not only in the
oppression and degradation of the poor, but in war
and militarism, and in all the waste, extravagance, and
misdirection of class government. How many of them
are conscious of the profound incongruity of their
position?</p>

<p>In the history of human thought opinion has
hardened often prematurely into dogma, and dogma has
usually degenerated into pedantry. Dogma has often
been simply the expression of egotism, which had not the
saving grace either to be loyal to truth or really helpful
to mankind. So it has been in the development of
socialism. Its champions have too frequently failed
in keeping a single eye and mind on a task which
requires insight, self-restraint, loyalty, and consistency,
as well as energy and enthusiasm. A great cause
demands the best and noblest service. Such a cause as
socialism demands from its supporters the self-denial
<span class='pageno' title='390' id='Page_390'></span>
which will suppress the many phases of an excessive,
disorderly, morbid, and malignant egotism that has done
so much harm in the past—no easy task for human
nature.</p>

<p>It is a very serious result alike of the past history
and of the present policy of socialists that the practical
work of emancipating labour has to such a degree been
postponed to a remote and hypothetical future. They
form only a small minority in the legislatures of the
leading European countries. This minority is increasing,
and is likely to increase. But there is no present
probability of an increase that would win political
power by parliamentary action.</p>

<p>According to the prevalent socialism the goal of the
whole movement is to acquire possession of the means
of production. Such a conception lays excessive stress
on the dead and passive instruments of labour. It
ascribes too much importance to the economic factor.
The economic factor is most important, but the cardinal
thing in socialism is the living and active principle
of association, and the essential thing for the working
man to acquire is the capacity and habit of association.
In other words, the motive power of socialism must
be found in the mind and character of men guided by
science and inspired by the highest ethical ideals, and
who have attained to the insight and capacity requisite
for associated action.</p>

<p>But in making those criticisms let us remember
that the social democracy is still in its unformed youth.
The socialist parties of most European countries have
<span class='pageno' title='391' id='Page_391'></span>
sprung up since 1870. They have had, through much
labour and tribulation, to shape their organisation,
principles, and policy. How natural it was that they
should follow a master mind like Marx, who had
manfully and unsparingly devoted his entire life to
their cause! And how natural too that they should
have no trust in other classes, and refuse all manner
of compromise with them!</p>

<p>And we should fail in an accurate presentation of
our subject if we did not emphasise the fact that the
present position of labour is the result of a vast effort
of practical and constructive work. In all departments
labour had to start from the very beginning not many
years ago. The socialist parties with their programmes
represent a strenuous and painful process of thought
and organisation. Through the trade unions the ill-informed,
untrained, suspicious, and turbulent democracy
of labour has been drilled into habits of common
action. How much of enthusiasm and high principle,
of persevering toil and patient attention to detail has
been put into the co-operative movement!</p>

<p>There are now most significant symptoms that all
the diverse forms of working-class activity are being
consolidated into one great movement. We have seen
how in Belgium trade unions and co-operative societies
work in harmony with the socialist party. So they
also do in Denmark. In Italy the three classic forms of
labour activity, trade unionism, co-operation, and the
Friendly Society, have come to an understanding
which is inspired by socialist aims. Generally we may
<span class='pageno' title='392' id='Page_392'></span>
say that the tendency in all countries is for organised
labour to become socialistic.</p>

<p>In nearly all countries the interests of the rural
workers have been by socialists neglected or sacrificed
for the industrial workers. This is particularly observable
in agrarian questions and questions of tariff. They
have not seen that at least temporary legislation has
been required to save the rural workers from ruin by the
exceptional competition of cheap farm products from
America. Generally they have considered the interests of
the workers as consumers rather than as producers. The
Socialist Revolutionary Party in Russia have, however,
seriously faced the agrarian problem in their programme
in language of carefully calculated vagueness.
Proceeding from the basis of the old communal ownership,
they advocate the socialisation of all land under
an administration of popular self-government, central
and local. ‘The use of the land will be based on
labour and the principle of equality, that is to say, it
will guarantee the satisfaction of the needs of the
producer, working himself individually or in society.’
Rent will be used for collective needs. The subsoil
will belong to the State. In Finland, which is the most
socialistic country of Europe, the Social Democratic
Party has also specially dealt with the agrarian question.</p>

<p>While it has hitherto been the too general tendency
of socialists to distrust and oppose the existing system
of government and administration, they are now in
point of fact taking a larger part in the work of state
and commune. Such work, like all other practical work,
<span class='pageno' title='393' id='Page_393'></span>
will serve as a wholesome discipline for parties whose
energies have been too much expended and wasted in
sterile opposition and unprofitable criticism. And it
may lead them to see that the antagonism of other
parties may be due to honest ignorance or well-justified
doubt. Even in Germany Bebel admits that so much
intercourse in the Reichstag and its committees between
Social Democrats and the other parties has led to a
friendlier feeling among them. But the main point
that we wish to bring out here is that organised and
progressive labour in all countries and in all its departments,
trade unions, co-operative societies, etc., is being
more and more inspired by socialistic aims, and tends
more and more to form a solid and organic movement
on practical lines. How far the movement may in the
future conform or attain to the collectivist type remains
to be seen.</p>

<p>We must particularly emphasise the fact that nothing
adverse to a reasonable patriotism, to religion, marriage,
or the family, is now found in the programmes of
parties or in the resolutions of congresses. The International
and the Socialist Parties clearly recognise that
their task is the emancipation of labour, and that it is
of an economic and political nature. Those who mix
up this great problem with questions of religion and
marriage do so on their own responsibility. They have
no right to speak on behalf of socialism, and have no
influence or authority beyond what they may personally
possess.</p>

<p>In our review we have had much to say of the
<span class='pageno' title='394' id='Page_394'></span>
possibilities of revolution. To all who shrink from
sudden change the experience of the Labour Party in
Australia should be reassuring. The Labour Party of
the Commonwealth attained to power in 1904 and again
in 1908. But the Party when in power can do very
little. It is only one of three or four parties. When
in power it must depend on outside support. Thus do
the desires and ideals of men find their limitations in
human nature and in our environment. What men
have most to fear as the greatest danger, particularly in
English-speaking lands, is not sudden change, but the
indifference and neglect which make change slow and
inadequate. The efforts of labour to raise itself deserve
our entire sympathy and our most careful study.</p>

<p>Force devoid of counsel, whether it be of the reaction
or of the revolution, will only result in increase of evil.
Evil in itself each tends to aggravate and perpetuate the
other. We can avert the baneful consequences of both
only by pursuing with temperate energy the course of
well-considered and beneficent change. To guide the
vast and ever-growing labour movement of the world
into paths which shall be wise, righteous, peaceful, and
happy, this is the task and, we hope, will be the achievement
of the twentieth century. Happy the men who
have the good-will, sympathy, and insight to make a
worthy contribution to this great work!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br/><br/>CONCLUSION</h2>

<p>In the last chapter we have seen how in many lands the
social democracy is seeking to reach its goal by parliamentary
action, and how in France, Italy, and Russia
the socialist movement tends less or more to assume
an aggressive and violent form. We have seen how
socialism is everywhere becoming the creed of organised
labour. The socialist parties and the trade unions are
the organised and articulate expression of the labour
of the world, and they are being combined into one great
movement. We must, therefore, understand the socialist
movement as having its basis and its background in a
vast reality which as yet has only partially found voice
and organisation. One of the most striking features in
recent history is to be found in the symptoms which
so frequently appear of a latent and undefined socialism,
which only needs a fitting occasion to call it forth, and
which forms a serious but incalculable quantity in the
forces of our time. In these symptoms the seeing eye
can discern labour moving uneasily under its chronic
burden. The unorganised labour breaks out in street
<span class='pageno' title='396' id='Page_396'></span>
riots and agrarian risings. Labour partially organised
in Russia shows an intense revolutionary energy. While
the prevalent socialism seeks to gain its ends by peaceful
action the situation contains serious possibilities of
revolution, especially in Eastern Europe.</p>

<p>It behoves all men of good-will in every country
to ponder the extreme gravity of the situation which
is being established throughout the civilised world.
Are we to face a confused struggle of the old sort
between those who have and those who have not,
or are we to see the blessed and beneficent action of a
great transforming principle? Is it to be a contest
for the possession of political power, carried on with
violence, and pregnant with incalculable disaster to
all concerned? Or may we expect to watch the
peaceful progress of a new type of industry gradually
but effectually realised, under the guidance of men
inspired by high economic and ethical ideals?</p>

<p>In England we have good ground to hope for a
peaceful solution. Among our working classes there is
a notable absence of rancour, and even of bitterness.
But it would be very unwise to count upon the continuance
of this spirit, and most unfair to make it an
occasion or excuse for further neglect. It should rather
be a stimulus to a truer appreciation of the position
and needs of the working class. If we survey English
history to the beginning of the nineteenth century, our
main difficulty is to determine whether our sins of
omission or commission have been the greater. Both
have been heinous and enormous. In the village community
<span class='pageno' title='397' id='Page_397'></span>
as it existed long ago we see comprehended
all that we now call land, labour, and capital. For the
worker it performed the services that are now rendered
by the trade union, the co-operative society, the friendly
and benefit society, and the insurance society. It stood
also for local government, and even to a large degree
for what now is national government, defence, justice,
and for education so far as was possible long ago. The
economic, social, and political life of the men of those
earliest times was summed up in the village community.</p>

<p>On the rise of feudalism this village community
was transformed into the manor, and on the downfall
of feudalism the manor was changed to the modern
parish, definable as ‘a distinct area, in which a separate
poor-rate is, or can be, levied.’ For a long period after
the Black Death in 1349 labour was scarce and had
a great opportunity. Through the conversion of small
holdings into sheep-runs and the dissolution of the
monasteries, labour was made superfluous and helpless.
It was a tragic reversal of the situation which has
had serious consequences during all the centuries that
have followed. The opportunities and advantages which
were offered to the worker in ancient times by the village
community were at the close of the reign of Elizabeth
reduced to the miserable privilege of poor relief! The
worker could not be regarded as included within the
body politic or social. He was no longer a citizen or
member of the community. He was a landless serf, the
subject of the landed class, and his position was determined
by class legislation and class administration.
<span class='pageno' title='398' id='Page_398'></span></p>

<p>When the change came from class legislation to
<span class='it'>laissez faire</span>, his position was little improved. Centuries
of oppression were followed by generations of neglect.
Thus the English workers have suffered in succession
from evils of two kinds, from the evils of oppression
and from the evils of neglect. This aspect of English
history is summed up and condemned in the single fact
that we had no national system of education till 1870, a
fact all the more striking because Scotland, though much
later in its political and economic development, had an
enlightened system of education at a very early date.</p>

<p>Factory workers gained much dining the nineteenth
century. But even yet the State has hardly
done anything substantial for the rural workers.
Scarcely a voice has been raised for a class which
has borne the chief burden of national industry, of
colonisation and war, which for so many centuries
carried Church and State, aristocracy and squirearchy,
on its much-enduring shoulders. Some of us hoped
that in 1885 the time had at last come. We all know
what happened to defer it again. Will the State never
give heed to such a duty till the demand grows clamorous
and agitation menacing? No class has done so
much and received so little as the rural workers.
Every man connected with the ruling class in England
should be ashamed to look one of the peasantry in the
face. It is the continual neglect of the needs and
claims of the people that makes a peaceful change
difficult and prepares for revolution.</p>

<p>There are however, many very promising symptoms.
<span class='pageno' title='399' id='Page_399'></span>
Among these we may note a growing spirit of conciliation
and of sympathy with the claims of labour, shown
particularly in the friendly and courteous reception
accorded to the newly founded Labour Party. In the
ruling and possessing classes we may observe an increasing
recognition of the necessity to make substantial
concessions to the needs and aspirations of the workers.
One of the brightest of recent symptoms was the atmosphere,
enlightened, sympathetic, and generous, which
pervaded the discussions at the Pan-Anglican Congress
in 1908. It was a sign of the times. No one could
accuse the Congress of being a revolutionary gathering.
We may expect that the influence of its members
among the conservative and influential classes all over
the English-speaking world will have good results.</p>

<p>We have abundant evidence that the American
people have done much hard thinking on social politics
during recent years. A striking instance of it appears
in President Roosevelt’s message to Congress in
December 1908. We may summarise as follows the
proposals for social legislation which it contained.
Besides the general control of the great corporations
which he has all along urged, he advocated supervision
of corporate finance, a progressive inheritance tax on
large fortunes, lightening of the burden of taxation
on the small man, prohibition of child labour, diminution
of woman labour, shortening of hours of all
mechanical labour, an eight hours’ day to be extended
as soon and as far as practicable to the entire work to
be carried on by Government. He particularly urges the
<span class='pageno' title='400' id='Page_400'></span>
immediate passing of an effective Employers’ Liability
Act. This is a good beginning, and it is a happy omen
that such legislation should be advocated by a man
with so fearless and stainless a record as Mr. Roosevelt.
If the American people are prepared to follow him a
beneficent solution of many grave problems is assured.</p>

<p>In the foregoing pages we have discussed the State
as a possible engine of social amelioration. But we
should not forget that the most hopeful movement of
recent times, the co-operative movement, owes little to
the State. The State has very great power, but it has
no magical power. And it is a grave mistake to regard
it too much as the pivot of social evolution. The State
itself is only a phase of social evolution. We can trace
its rise and progress in history, and its record has not
been a good one. While it has been a decisive element
of strength in the struggle for existence, it has also too
long and too much been an organ for the exploiting of
the mass of the people by the ruling minority.</p>

<p>Recent English socialism has given excessive prominence
to the State; to the prejudice of the question,
and for two reasons. The State means compulsion, and
it suggests the official. Socialism carried out by the
State suggests bureaucracy, and is opposed to freedom.
Such a conception of the subject is most misleading and
in the highest degree prejudicial to progress.</p>

<p>In its propaganda the Fabian Society has too often
interpreted socialism in terms of the State and the
municipality. Though most important, the State and
the municipality are only historic phases of deeper
<span class='pageno' title='401' id='Page_401'></span>
principles and forces. It may be a way to make the
subject intelligible. But this convenience is more than
counterbalanced by the tactical disadvantage that orators
on the other side find an easy way of ‘confuting’
socialism, by asking how the State or municipality can
grapple with the vast complexity of modern industry,
and how freedom could be conserved under the compulsory
action of the State and its officials.</p>

<p>The proposal in the Fabian Basis to transfer
industrial capital to the community ‘without compensation’
is open to still wider and more serious objection.
The claim of socialism to be the future form of
industrial organisation rests on its superior efficiency.
It claims to prevail because it is best, and it needs no
arbitrary exercise of power to carry it through.
Theoretically and practically, from an economic and
political, social, and moral point of view, it lays claim
to superior competence to do the best for mankind by
giving fuller scope to the free, many-sided development
of the highest human life. In this and in other points
the language of the Fabian Basis is too suggestive
of the rigid and abstract collectivism set forth in the
prevalent socialism.</p>

<p>If we are to understand the true inwardness of our
subject we must go behind the State. Rightly understood,
socialism is concerned with principles and tendencies
which are more fundamental than the State.
As I have said in another place, ‘Socialism is a new
type of social and economic organisation, the aim and
tendency of which are to reform the existing society, the
<span class='pageno' title='402' id='Page_402'></span>
State included. It is a principle of social change which
goes beyond and behind the existing State, which will
modify the State, but does not depend upon it for its
realisation.’<a id='r1_17'/><a href='#f1_17' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a> To be more precise, socialism is a principle
of economic organisation, with the correlated
social and ethical principles constituting a great ideal,
to which the State must be made to conform. How far
the State may in this way need to be transformed is a
question which hardly concerns us at present.</p>

<p>In the chapter on the Purified Socialism I attempted
to show how ‘the true meaning of socialism is given
in the dominating tendencies of social evolution.’<a id='r2_17'/><a href='#f2_17' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a>
Through the fog of controversy we should clearly see
that the fundamental principle of socialism is marked
by extreme simplicity. The keynote of socialism is the
principle of association. Only by associating for the
ownership and control of land and capital can the people
protect themselves against the evils of competition and
monopoly. Only by association can they control and
utilise the large industry for the general good. It means
that industry should be carried on by free associated
workers utilising a joint capital with a view to an
equitable system of distribution. And in the political
organisation of society it has for complement a like ideal,
namely, that the old methods of force, subjection, and
exploitation should give place to the principle of free
association. Through the application and development
of the principle of free association it seeks to transform
State, municipality, and industry in all their departments.</p>

<p><span class='pageno' title='403' id='Page_403'></span></p>

<p>Socialism rests on the great ideals of freedom and
justice, of brotherhood and mutual service. It may
well claim to be the heir of the great ideals of the
greatest races. The Hebrew ideal of truth, righteousness,
and mercy, which on its ethical side was widened
and deepened into the Christian ideals of love, brotherhood,
and mutual service, and the Greek ideal of the
true, the good, and the beautiful, all may and should
be accepted by socialism, and they should be supplemented
by the Roman conceptions of law, order, and continuity,
but with far wider aims and meanings. In its
law of mutual service, by which it at once asserted the
interdependence of the members of the social organism
and a profound conception of social duty, Christianity
went deeper, both in philosophy and practice, than
the French Revolution with its watchwords of liberty,
equality, and fraternity. All these ideals, though not
seldom abused and discredited in the rough school of
human experience, are in their essence profoundly true
and real, and they all meet and are summed up in a
worthy conception of the great socialistic ideal.</p>

<p>These ideals, it will be seen, go together; and it
should be specially observed that freedom for the mass
of mankind can be won and maintained only by association.
In the competitive struggle the victors are few;
the many are defeated and become subject. It is a
delusion to suppose that freedom and competition are
really compatible.</p>

<p>This truth has received striking exemplification in
the recent history of America. In the course of a
<span class='pageno' title='404' id='Page_404'></span>
single generation the country has passed under a system
of competition from industrial freedom to what looks
very like industrial oligarchy. The men who could
best adapt themselves to the conditions of competition
have won; and the trusts which they have organised
are the natural results. The oligarchy appears to be
the very unwelcome but very natural result of the
free struggle for success which has been the accepted
system and the ideal of the American people.</p>

<p>Rightly understood, socialism will thus be seen to
embody the highest conceptions of life, ancient and
modern, and the highest aspirations of Christian ethics
interpreted and applied by the experience of centuries.
The failures which we have experienced in realising our
ideals are no excuse for lowering them. They are far-reaching;
they are limited by obvious natural facts, and
cannot be realised in a day. But we should remember
that every step forward brings us nearer to the goal.</p>

<p>This great ideal remains, therefore, as a far-shining
goal to provoke and encourage the endeavours of men
to attain it. We cannot lower it, but we should be
grateful for every sincere attempt to reach it, for every
successful step towards it. For the rise and growth of
socialism a lower and, as some would reckon, a more
solid foundation is all that we need. The necessary
minimum is an enlightened self-interest. Socialism
does not aim at the extinguishing or superseding of the
self-regarding principle—that is impossible and absurd.
It seeks to regulate it, to place it under social guidance
and control. When and so far as the mass of the people
<span class='pageno' title='405' id='Page_405'></span>
in any particular country and throughout the world
gain a moderate, rational, and enlightened view of their
real needs and interests, then and so far will socialism
tend to be realised. While the elect souls have been and
are ready to go far in deeds of heroism and self-sacrifice,
nothing more is demanded of the average mass of mankind
than to learn to understand their true interests.
On this prosaic basis much has already been done.</p>

<p>While the competitive system still holds the field,
we have very good grounds for thinking that it should
pass away, and is passing away. We have seen how,
in accordance with the fundamental principles of
socialism, the State is becoming, not in name only, but
in reality, an association for the promotion of common
national interests, in so far as they can well be furthered
by the central organ; and we have also seen how the
municipality or commune is really beginning to perform
the same functions for local purposes. In the co-operative
system, in the growth of trade unions, of arbitration,
boards of conciliation, and similar forms of organisation,
we see partial efforts towards a comprehensive system
of social control over the industrial processes. And the
natural development of the company is providing the
mechanism whereby it may also be placed under social
management. It is clear that along these lines the
movement may spread till it cover the whole field of
our social-economic life and place the competitive
spirit under an effective and reasonable regulation.</p>

<p>It may be well here to speak more at length regarding
the functions of the State under a rational
<span class='pageno' title='406' id='Page_406'></span>
socialism. Of all the absurdities entertained about
socialism by its critics, and apparently also by some
of its adherents, the most grotesque is the idea that
everything will be done by the direct action of the
State. It will rather be the aim of a reasonable
socialism to diminish and lighten the pressure of the
State as an engine of compulsion and coercion, and
to offer suitable scope for the free action of the individual
and the family, for free association and
voluntary agreement. For this reason one of the
most urgent needs of such a socialism will be to promote
local autonomy, and also to foster what we may
call the autonomy of the individual and the family, but
in a living organic relation to the whole community.</p>

<p>We must therefore regard social action as proceeding
not only from above downwards, but also from below
upwards, and indeed mutually and reciprocally through
all the members and departments of society, from the
centre to the extremities and from the extremities to
the centre. But even this is only a very imperfect
explanation of an organic process which expresses itself
in a consensus of life and action.</p>

<p>The federal idea also very imperfectly expresses the
relation that the parts may bear to each other and to
the whole in a great society, but it helps us to understand.
This federal conception may have a great
future, in Austria-Hungary, in Russia, and in the
Balkan Peninsula, for the solution of political difficulties.
The British Empire is being transformed into a free
association of free States. And we may add that the
<span class='pageno' title='407' id='Page_407'></span>
highest directing agency in the Empire, the British
Cabinet, is a combination of the leading men of the
strongest party for the time being, who in the main
hold the same political views, and who are united,
not according to a statute or a written constitution, or
any kind of formal contract, but by what for want of a
better name we may call a gentlemen’s agreement. The
British Cabinet may be regarded as a free association
of gentlemen, the Premier presiding <span class='it'>primus inter pares</span>.</p>

<p>As regards socialism, one of the most urgent needs
for the promoting of local and individual autonomy
is fully to reconstitute the homestead and the village
community. The homestead will satisfy the most
natural craving for individual property and for a
family and ancestral home, with all the beneficent
and sacred association implied in such a home. ‘The
area of the homestead should be sufficient to employ
and support a family.’ In my book <span class='it'>Progress and the
Fiscal Problem</span> (p. 172) I have spoken of such a
homestead as a freehold. But it matters comparatively
little what legal term we employ, provided the
occupancy be permanent and not dependent on the
will of officials connected with the central government.
There should, however, be some guarantee that the
social conditions of occupancy be fulfilled. Tax or
rent might reasonably be paid into a social fund for
collective needs. Here, as in other matters, one of the
difficulties in elucidating a reasonable socialism lies in
the fact that we have to use old words to express facts
and institutions that may be expected to become new,
<span class='pageno' title='408' id='Page_408'></span>
or at least to undergo a material change in the course
of social development. For such words, it should be
observed, have not a final and conclusive meaning
which can be stereotyped and put into a definition in a
dictionary or legal enactment, but can only be unfolded
in actual human use and in the process of changing
human history. It is meant that the homestead and
the village community be restored to a full and beneficent
life under modern conditions and to serve
modern needs.</p>

<p>Of the State for the near future the most desirable
type undoubtedly is one which, while providing a strong
and efficient central organisation, gives a real and
substantial autonomy to the various parts and members
of which it may be composed. And it will be one of
the noblest functions of such a State to train to a
higher social and political life the peoples which are
now subject and by some are reckoned inferior. This
duty Great Britain is performing in India and Egypt.
The United States of America have undertaken a like
office in Cuba and the Philippine Islands. It might
even be possible under wise guidance to lead peoples
like the Kaffirs direct from the warlike and tribal
stage into the industrial and co-operative stage. Some
day, perhaps, the best solution for racial difficulties in
America may be to give some kind of special autonomy
to the negroes in the hot regions where they are most
thickly planted near the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<p>Progress in these high matters will obviously
depend on the growing insight and sympathy of the
<span class='pageno' title='409' id='Page_409'></span>
rulers, as well as on the increasing enlightenment, self-control,
and political experience of the subject races.
It is a most important matter that the task has been
worthily begun. Such work is in quality like mercy—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'>

<p class='line0'>It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.</p>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>It will most effectually tend to cultivate the nobler
political life in the States that have undertaken it, and
we may believe that it will in the course of time train
the more backward races in the higher life of self-government,
and introduce among them the co-operative
organisation of industry which is required by modern
conditions. In all this we see a striking contrast to the
older empires, in which the domination of race, nation,
and class was twice cursed, a curse alike to rulers and
ruled, to master and slave, to lord and serf. In these
matters generally a reasonable socialism demands the
transformation of empire into a free association of free
States bound by ties of mutual service. For a fuller
treatment of this idea I may refer my readers to the
chapter ‘Bonds of Empire’ in my book <span class='it'>South Africa
Old and New</span> (p. 95).</p>

<p>Referring to questions which were raised in other
parts of this book, we believe that recent modifications
in the Iron Law of Wages, which have been alleged in
confutation of Lassalle’s position, are really symptoms
of the decline of capitalism. Such modifications are
due to influences which are inconsistent with the continued
predominance of capitalism. And here we may
say explicitly that socialism has no controversy with
<span class='pageno' title='410' id='Page_410'></span>
the prevalent political economy in so far as it is a correct
description and analysis of the prevalent economic
system. The aim of socialism is to show why and how
that system should and must pass away, and is passing
away; and we may believe that this is a much worthier
task, from the point of view both of science and the
public good, than the microscopic investigation of the
conditions of the competitive system, which constitutes
so large a portion of the current political economy.
Anyhow the practical aim of socialism is to remove
and abolish the conditions under which the so-called
laws of political economy had their validity. Regarding
the assumption so often made by economists that individual
self-interest is the solid basis on which science
must build, we can only say that it is not science, but
a one-sided and erroneous conception of human nature,
of human society, and of social evolution, which
obviously requires the most serious correction.</p>

<p>With regard to the population question, and the
question of the struggle for existence so intimately
connected with it, we can no longer ignore the practice
of limitation of families, which has now become so prevalent.
It cannot be regarded as a satisfactory solution
of the population question. In the past it has been one
of the surest signs of a stagnant and decadent nation.
No race or nation, in which the rights and duties of
motherhood or the family moralities are slightly valued,
can hope permanently to maintain a high standard of
life and worth. We may most surely forecast the
future of a class or nation from the manner in which
<span class='pageno' title='411' id='Page_411'></span>
the rights and duties of motherhood are observed by
it. To use the language of biology, race suicide is the
most unfavourable variation which classes and nations
can inflict upon themselves. But we are not in this
book concerned with the general question. What we
have to note here is that the practice of limiting
families, having become so prevalent, will tend to
diminish the intensity of the struggle for existence,
which it is the aim of socialism to regulate. For this
reason we must recognise it as a fact which has an
important bearing on our subject.</p>

<p>It was a theory of the Marx school that the <span class='it'>bourgeoisie</span>,
in the course of the development of capitalism, would
be ‘no longer capable of controlling the industrial
world.’<a id='r3_17'/><a href='#f3_17' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a> The recent development of the trust system
in America and Germany has shown that the <span class='it'>bourgeoisie</span>
are only too capable of doing so on the vastest scale.
The leaders of the trusts are showing that they can
regulate production, wages, prices, and the markets, not
for nations only but for the world. Oligarchies showed
their capacity in Rome, Carthage, Venice, and Holland
for centuries. They came to ruin at last, but the causes
of their ruin were wider and deeper than mere want of
capacity. With these we are not concerned here. The
concern of socialism is that the oligarchy or plutocracy
which is foreshadowed in the gigantic trust system
should not be allowed to gain a permanent footing, but
should be regulated and transformed in the way required
by the public good. The trust is a menace alike to
<span class='pageno' title='412' id='Page_412'></span>
labour and to society. With the growth of the trust
system free competition really ceases to exist, and the
alternative lies between a gigantic system of monopoly
and socialism.</p>

<p>We believe also that Marx made a serious mistake
in holding that the further development of capitalism
will be marked by the growing ‘wretchedness, oppression,
slavery, degeneracy, and exploitation’<a id='r4_17'/><a href='#f4_17' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[4]</span></sup></a> of the
working class. Facts and reasonable expectations combine
clearly to indicate that the democracy, on which
the social evolution of the future depends, is marked
by a growing intellectual, moral, and political capacity,
and by an increasing freedom and prosperity; and all
these things make it only more ardent and capable for
further progress and for the great tasks that lie before
it. Social progress must in the last resort depend on
the character and capacity of the human beings concerned
in it. The democracy, the representative and
promoter of the new order, shows a growing fitness for
its world-historic mission. The claim of socialism to be
the dominant form of social organisation in the future
must ultimately be its efficiency to fulfil the great ends
of social union, and the decisive element in this efficiency
must be the fitness of the agents who are to
realise it.</p>

<p>This is a point of supreme and far-reaching importance
which it will be well for us to ponder. All
social problems in the long run resolve themselves into
the question of human character. The moral forces
<span class='pageno' title='413' id='Page_413'></span>
control the world and the course of history. It has
been the special function of socialism to show that a
real and durable freedom can be established only on an
economic basis. We should also not forget that such
freedom can be attained and secured only by loyalty to
reason and especially to moral law. Freedom and
social progress, reason and morality, are correlated and
organic conceptions which go together and can thrive
only in harmony.</p>

<p>Government of State and municipality is only a
mechanism, of which the action for good or evil will
depend on the spirit by which it is moved. The
nationalisation of railways may merely open up a new
field of corruption, if there is not integrity to manage
them for the public good. Noble ideals are of no avail,
if they remain outside of our spiritual framework: they
must be assimilated and become part of us. Fine sentiments,
unless they are consolidated into character and
translated into habitual action, may become an insidious
and harmful form of self-indulgence. Let it be understood
that in the great struggle for a really free commonwealth
against organised wealth, called plutocracy, on
which men are now entering, we shall achieve victory
only by deserving it. The sacred cause of freedom will
not be maintained by mammon-worshippers, parasites,
and pedants. No nation or class whose women are
slaves of self-indulgence and of fashion can expect to be
free. We cannot hope that freedom will thrive among
the base and mean, or the hysterical, irresponsible,
frivolous, and apathetic.
<span class='pageno' title='414' id='Page_414'></span></p>

<p>To use the words of John Milton, it was a ‘strenuous
liberty’ which was cherished and maintained by our
Puritan forefathers, the fathers and founders of the
American Commonwealth. We know with what solemnity
and earnestness, with what gravity, deliberation,
and foresight they entered on the long struggle against
Stuart tyranny. If the Americans and we are to
succeed in the coming struggle against plutocracy, an
abundant measure of the high and virile qualities
which characterised their forefathers and ours will be
needed.</p>

<p>Happily signs are not wanting that a spirit and
character strenuous and capable of the task of reformation
will be forthcoming. In all civilised countries,
and especially in America, men have been accomplices
in the sin of mammon-worship: success in the struggle
for wealth, with its many base and unscrupulous incidents,
has been far too highly esteemed. There has
been, especially in America, a great moral awakening,
which we may expect to have good results among
all classes. As regards the working classes, we have
seen how long and hard in most countries has been
their discipline of privation and sorrow. The representatives
of labour have for generations undergone a
stern and severe training in prison and exile. In Russia
to-day they have been suffering and inflicting horrors
which have been far worse.</p>

<p>But as we have repeatedly had occasion to point out
in this book, their training in constructive work, in
political organisation, in trade unions, and co-operative
<span class='pageno' title='415' id='Page_415'></span>
societies has been vastly more efficacious. Most promising
of all; as we have seen, is the co-operative
movement, because it best combines the collective use
of the means of production and exchange with individual
freedom and responsibility. In the vast and ever-widening
co-operative movement we can see a new
society rising in the midst of the old. Every year it
widens and grows, and we hope it will grow and widen
till the old, with all its false and base ideals, its unreason,
its militarism, its mismanagement, waste, and
extravagance has been put away. Hearts have been
burning with the sacred fire of noble ideals in the
promoting of this grand work. Imaginations have been
haunted with beautiful dreams, which have not been
vain. But we should prize not less the patient and persevering
integrity which, through a multitude of petty
and prosaic details, is bearing the movement onward
to an ever higher position in the world. At Ghent and
other places we may already see both in spirit and
material outline the city that is to be, the new society
that is rising to make life happy and beautiful for the
people who have mourned so long! In the application
of the co-operative principle to agriculture we can at
last see an ending to the oppression of the tiller of the
soil by the usurer and middleman, which has been a
stain on civilisation since it began thousands of years
ago in the valleys of the Euphrates and the Nile.</p>

<p>The day is coming, perhaps it may be near at hand,
when we shall be able to discover and to apply the
true tests of greatness. When, with their help, we
<span class='pageno' title='416' id='Page_416'></span>
are able to write history in a really scientific manner,
we shall find that the Napoleons and the others, the
records of whose doings now fill our libraries, were not
great at all, but the reverse of it, and that the true
heroes and benefactors of the nineteenth century were
the poor weavers of Rochdale and Ghent, who started
and carried forward the co-operative movement. All
honour to them for what they have done!</p>

<p>And yet all that they have done is only the solid
and hopeful beginning of the realisation of our dreams.
For the ideal is superb and exacting. Men are slow to
move towards it. They find it hard even to understand
and appreciate its beauty and excellence. Let us
fervently hope that after the way towards a good and
beautiful life for humanity has been so clearly pointed
out, an ever-increasing multitude may have the wisdom
to walk in it.</p>

<p>We believe that the transition to a reasonable
socialism will be marked by a long and testing process
of social selection. From the beginning of the movement
socialist theories have been subjected to the
tests of discussion and of experience. Socialist parties
have also undergone very severe trial in debate, organisation,
and action. Trade unions and labour parties
have been obliged to go through a very hard course
of discipline and of suffering.</p>

<p>It should be particularly observed that these tests
more and more belong to the domain of intelligence, of
moral character, and of skilled organisation. Success
in the struggle for existence depends on fitness or
<span class='pageno' title='417' id='Page_417'></span>
adaptation to surrounding conditions. In the lower
stages of the struggle for existence, as we saw in
Chap. XII., the conditions were of a lower order. In the
ascending struggle for a higher existence the conditions
are higher and offer a severer and more exacting test.
Labour which aspires to a higher life must stand those
higher tests. Socialist programmes and resolutions are
therefore perfectly right in dwelling on the urgent need
for agitation, education, and organisation as a means
of training the working class for its great duties and
its high career. And we may repeat that the most
urgent need of all is the capacity, moral and intellectual,
for association.</p>

<p>Thus the transition to socialism can be made only
by increasing and widening adaptation to the higher
conditions of intelligence, character, and organisation.
Once made, the change to socialism will place men in
a higher moral and economic environment. As we saw,
two vital human interests will under socialism be no
longer subject to the conditions of competition, the
working day and the ‘daily bread.’ Every able man
will be under obligation to perform reasonable service
for a competent livelihood; but beyond this his time
and faculties will be his own. In this better environment
men will find the rights and the opportunities
which will give them the basis and scope for a better
life. There will be corresponding duties and obligations.
And for those who, from vices and defects of temperament
or of habit, are not disposed to fulfil such
obligations suitable measures of social discipline will
<span class='pageno' title='418' id='Page_418'></span>
need to be devised. The weak and disabled will receive
suitable guidance and support. But we may be assured
that all normally constituted men will be ready to
respond to all natural and reasonable calls.</p>

<p>Social service will be the main field for emulation,
rivalry, and ambition, and here the struggle for a higher
life may be carried on under the better conditions which
will prevail. We may call it competition if we will,
but it will be competition on terms that differ entirely
from those which exist under the present system. It
will be competition for social distinction and rewards.
The reticence, secrecy, and hypocrisy, the jealousy and
detraction, which are now so common will pass away.
Men will be able to live sincerely and openly. Their
record will be an open and public one, which their
fellow-citizens will be able to read and estimate fairly.
And we should avoid the grave mistake of confounding
the human qualities that make for success in the
present competition with the qualities that would meet
with approval under the new system. The qualities
that command success at present we all know. The
qualities that would meet with favour under a reasonable
socialism will be those which answer to the great
ideals we have spoken of, and particularly those which
fit men for the best social service.</p>

<p>The waste and demoralisation, the injustice and
cruelty, which are so rife under the present system will
pass away. But the new era will work for much more
than the mere abolition of evil. It will make for the
positive and integral development of the highest human
<span class='pageno' title='419' id='Page_419'></span>
life. Natural capacity in all the forms that are consistent
with social good will have free scope for unfolding
itself. We may believe that in the majority of lives
the exercise of natural endowment will be in direct
conformity with the requirements of social service. It
will obviously be for the good of society that each will
do the work for which he is best fitted. Spiritual
teaching, scientific discovery, literature, art, and music
will all be duly prized and rewarded as modes of social
service. But if the aspirant wishes to do his share of
social work in the form of some ordinary craft, in order
to devote his ample leisure to a special pursuit entirely
of his own choosing, he will be free to do so. In this
matter freedom will be an interest of the first order.</p>

<p>The lesson taught by much recent experience and
the goal of many convergent tendencies seem undoubtedly
to be, that society should control industry
in its own interest. An industry carried on by free
associated men would be in perfect accord with other
forms and methods of progress, ethical, political, and
economic. The purified socialism may be regarded as
the co-ordination and consummation of every other
form of human progress, inasmuch as it applies to the
use of man all the factors of scientific, mechanical, and
artistic development in harmony with the prevailing
political and ethical ideas.</p>

<p>It is therefore a most desirable form of organisation.
And many large and growing symptoms show that it
is practicable. It is a type of organisation which may
take shape in a thousand diverse ways, according to
<span class='pageno' title='420' id='Page_420'></span>
the differences in historic conditions and in national
temperament. Within its limits, as we have seen, there
will be reasonable scope for individual development
and for every variety of liking and capacity consistent
with the well-being of others; but exceptional talent
and the generous enthusiasm which is its fitting
accompaniment will more and more find their proper
field in the service of society, an ideal which is already
largely realised in the democratic state.</p>

<p>In a rational socialism we may therefore see a long
and widening avenue of progress, along which the
improvement of mankind may be continued in a peaceful
and gradual, yet most hopeful, sure, and effective
way. Such a prospect offers the best remedy for the
apathy and frivolity, cynicism and pessimism, which
are now so prevalent; and it is the most effectual
counteractive to restlessness, discontent, and all the
evils and excesses of the revolutionary spirit. Under it
the social forces will consciously and directly work for
social ideals. The ideal will be made real, and might
and right will be reconciled. The real forces which
operate in modern history will be shaped by beneficent
ideals, till, as Tennyson sings,</p>

<h2>APPENDIX</h2>

<p>After the Revolution of 1830 the Saint-Simonists were
referred to in the French Chamber of Deputies as a sect who
advocated community of goods and of women. The following
communication in their defence was addressed to the
Chamber by Bazard and Enfantin, October 1, 1830:—</p>

<p>‘The Saint-Simonists undoubtedly do profess ideas on
the future of property and of women which are special to
themselves, and which are connected with views entirely
new and special on religion, authority, liberty—in short, on
all the great problems which are now being agitated over
the whole of Europe with so much disorder and violence;
but these ideas are very different from the opinions which
men attribute to them.</p>

<p>‘The system of community of goods is always understood
to mean equal division among all the members of
society, either of the means of production or of the fruit of
the labour of all.</p>

<p>‘The Saint-Simonists reject this equal division of property,
which in their eyes would constitute a greater
violence, a more revolting injustice, than the unequal division,
which was originally effected by force of arms, by
conquest.</p>

<p>‘For they believe in the natural inequality of men, and
regard this inequality as the very basis of association, as
the indispensable condition of social order.</p>

<p>‘They reject the system of community of goods, for
this would be a manifest violation of the first of all the
<span class='pageno' title='422' id='Page_422'></span>
moral laws, which it is their mission to teach, and which
enjoins that in the future each man should be placed
according to his capacity, and rewarded according to his
work.</p>

<p>‘But in virtue of this law they demand the abolition
of all the privileges of birth without exception, and consequently
the destruction of the right of inheritance, the
greatest of those privileges, which at present comprehends
them all, and of which the effect is to leave to chance the
distribution of social privileges amongst the small number
of those who can lay claim to them, and to condemn the
most numerous class to depravation, ignorance, and misery.</p>

<p>‘They demand that all the instruments of labour, land,
and capital, which at present form the divided stock of
private proprietors, should be exploited by associations
with a suitable gradation of functions, so that the task of
each may be the expression of his capacity, and his riches
the measure of his services.</p>

<p>‘The Saint-Simonists do not attack the institution of
private property, except in so far as it consecrates for
some the impious privilege of idleness—that is to say, of
living on the labour of others; except as it leaves to the
accident of birth the social status of individuals.</p>

<p>‘Christianity has delivered women from slavery, but it
has nevertheless condemned them to an inferior position,
and in Christian Europe we still see them everywhere
deprived of religious, political, and civil rights.</p>

<p>‘The Saint-Simonists announce their final liberation,
their complete emancipation, but they do not aim at
abolishing the sacred law of marriage proclaimed by
Christianity; on the contrary, they desire to fulfil this
law, to give it a new sanction, to add to the authority and
inviolability of the union which it consecrates.</p>

<p>‘Like Christians they demand that a single man be
united to a single woman; but they teach that the wife
should become the equal of the husband, and that, according
to the special grace with which God has endowed her
sex, she should be associated in the exercise of the triple
function of religion, the State, and the family, so that
<span class='pageno' title='423' id='Page_423'></span>
the social individual, which hitherto has been the man
only, may henceforward be man and woman.</p>

<p>‘The religion of Saint-Simon seeks only to abolish the
shameful traffic, the legal prostitution, which, under the
name of marriage, at present so frequently consecrates the
unnatural union of self-sacrifice and egotism, of intelligence
and ignorance, of youth and decrepitude.</p>

<p>‘Such are the most general ideas of the Saint-Simonists
on the changes which they demand in the arrangements of
property and in the social condition of women.’</p>

<h3>PROGRAMME OF THE SOCIALISTIC WORKING MEN’S PARTY OF GERMANY</h3>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;margin-bottom:1.5em;'><span class='sc'>Gotha</span>, <span class='it'>May</span> 1875.</p>

<p>I. Labour is the source of all wealth and all culture,
and as useful work in general is possible only through
society, so to society, that is to all its members, the entire
product belongs; while as the obligation to labour is
universal, all have an equal right to such product, each
one according to his reasonable needs.</p>

<p>In the existing society the instruments of labour are a
monopoly of the capitalist class; the subjection of the
working class thus arising is the cause of misery and
servitude in every form.</p>

<p>The emancipation of the working class demands the
transformation of the instruments of labour into the
common property of society and the co-operative control
of the total labour, with application of the product of
labour to the common good and just distribution of the
same.</p>

<p>The emancipation of labour must be the work of the
labouring class, in contrast to which all other classes are
only a reactionary mass.</p>

<p>II. Proceeding from these principles, the socialistic
working men’s party of Germany aims by all legal means
at the establishment of the free state and the socialistic
society, to destroy the Iron Law of Wages by abolishing
<span class='pageno' title='424' id='Page_424'></span>
the system of wage-labour, to put an end to exploitation
in every form, to remove all social and political inequality.</p>

<p>The socialistic working men’s party of Germany, though
acting first of all within the national limits, is conscious
of the international character of the labour movement,
and resolved to fulfil all the duties which this imposes on
the workmen, in order to realise the universal brotherhood
of men.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>In order to prepare the way for the solution of the
social question, the socialistic working men’s party of
Germany demands the establishment of socialistic productive
associations with State help under the democratic
control of the labouring people. The productive associations
are to be founded on such a scale both for industry
and agriculture that out of them may develop the socialistic
organisation of the total labour.</p>

<p>The socialistic working men’s party of Germany demands
as the basis of the State:—</p>

<p>I. Universal, equal, and direct right of electing and
voting, with secret and obligatory voting, of all citizens
from twenty years of age, for all elections and deliberations
in the State and local bodies. The day of election
or voting must be a Sunday or holiday.</p>

<p>II. Direct legislation by the people. Questions of war
and peace to be decided by the people.</p>

<p>III. Universal military duty. A people’s army in
place of the standing armies.</p>

<p>IV. Abolition of all exceptional laws, especially as regards
the press, unions, and meetings, and generally of all
laws which restrict freedom of thought and inquiry.</p>

<p>V. Administration of justice by the people. Free justice.</p>

<p>VI. Universal and equal education by the State. Compulsory
education. Free education in all public places of
instruction. Religion declared to be a private concern.</p>

<p>The socialistic working men’s party demands within the
existing society:</p>

<p>(1) Greatest possible extension of political rights and
liberties in the sense of the above demands.
<span class='pageno' title='425' id='Page_425'></span></p>

<p>(2) A single progressive income-tax for State and commune,
instead of the existing taxes, and especially of the
indirect taxes that oppress the people.</p>

<p>(3) Unrestricted right of combination.</p>

<p>(4) A normal working-day corresponding to the needs
of society. Prohibition of Sunday labour.</p>

<p>(5) Prohibition of labour of children, and of all women’s
labour that is injurious to health and morality.</p>

<p>(6) Laws for the protection of the life and health of
workmen. Sanitary control of workmen’s dwellings.
Inspection of mines, of factories, workshops, and home
industries by officials chosen by the workmen. An effective
Employers’ Liability Act.</p>

<p>(7) Regulation of prison labour.</p>

<p>(8) Workmen’s funds to be under the entire control of
the workmen.</p>

<h3>PROGRAMME OF THE KNIGHTS OF LABOUR OF AMERICA, 1885</h3>

<p>I. To make industrial and moral worth, not wealth, the
true standard of individual and national greatness.</p>

<p>II. To secure to the workers the full enjoyment of the
wealth they create; sufficient leisure in which to develop
their intellectual, moral, and social faculties; all the benefits,
recreation, and pleasures of association; in a word,
to enable them to share in the gains and honours of advancing
civilisation.</p>

<p>In order to secure these results, we demand of the
State:</p>

<p>III. The establishment of Bureaus of Labour Statistics,
that we may arrive at a correct knowledge of the educational,
moral, and financial condition of the labouring
masses.</p>

<p>IV. That the public lands, the heritage of the people,
be reserved for actual settlers; not another acre for railroads
or speculators: and that all lands now held for
speculative purposes be taxed to their full value.</p>

<p>V. The abrogation of all laws that do not bear equally
<span class='pageno' title='426' id='Page_426'></span>
upon capital and labour, and the removal of unjust technicalities,
delays, and discriminations in the administration
of justice.</p>

<p>VI. The adoption of measures providing for the health
and safety of those engaged in mining, manufacturing, and
building industries; and for indemnification to those engaged
therein for injuries received through lack of necessary
safeguards.</p>

<p>VII. The recognition by incorporation of trades-unions,
orders, and such other associations as may be organised by
the working masses to improve their condition and protect
their rights.</p>

<p>VIII. The enactment of laws to compel corporations to
pay their employees weekly, in lawful money, for the
labour of the preceding week, and giving mechanics and
labourers a first lien upon the product of their labour to
the extent of their full wages.</p>

<p>IX. The abolition of the contract system on national,
State, and municipal works.</p>

<p>X. The enactment of laws providing for arbitration between
employers and employed, and to enforce the decision
of the arbitrators.</p>

<p>XI. The prohibition by law of the employment of
children under fifteen years of age in workshops, mines,
and factories.</p>

<p>XII. To prohibit the hiring out of convict labour.</p>

<p>XIII. That a graduated income-tax be levied.</p>

<p>And we demand at the hands of the Congress:</p>

<p>XIV. The establishment of a national monetary system,
in which a circulating medium in necessary quantity shall
issue direct to the people, without the intervention of
banks; that all the national issue shall be full legal tender
in payment of all debts, public and private; and that the
Government shall not guarantee or recognise any private
banks, or create any banking corporations.</p>

<p>XV. That interest-bearing bonds, bills of credit or notes
shall never be issued by the Government, but that, when
need arises, the emergency shall be met by issue of legal
tender, non-interest-bearing money.
<span class='pageno' title='427' id='Page_427'></span></p>

<p>XVI. That the importation of foreign labour under
contract be prohibited.</p>

<p>XVII. That in connection with the post-office, the
Government shall organise financial exchanges, safe deposits
and facilities for deposit of the savings of the people
in small sums.</p>

<p>XVIII. That the Government shall obtain possession,
by purchase, under the rights of eminent domain, of all
telegraphs, telephones, and railroads, and that hereafter no
charter or licence be issued to any corporation for construction
or operation of any means of transporting intelligence,
passengers or freight.</p>

<p>And while making the foregoing demands upon the
State and National Government, we will endeavour to
associate our own labours:</p>

<p>XIX. To establish co-operative institutions such as will
tend to supersede the wage system, by the introduction of
a co-operative industrial system.</p>

<p>XX. To secure for both sexes equal pay for equal work.</p>

<p>XXI. To shorten the hours of labour by a general
refusal to work for more than eight hours.</p>

<p>XXII. To persuade employers to agree to arbitrate all
differences which may arise between them and their
employees, in order that the bonds of sympathy between
them may be strengthened and that strikes may be rendered
unnecessary.</p>

<h3>BASIS OF THE FABIAN SOCIETY</h3>

<p>The Fabian Society consists of socialists.</p>

<p>It therefore aims at the reorganisation of society by
the emancipation of Land and Industrial Capital from
individual and class ownership, and the vesting of them in
the community for the general benefit. In this way only
can the natural and acquired advantages of the country be
equitably shared by the whole people.</p>

<p>The Society accordingly works for the extinction of
private property in land and of the consequent individual
appropriation, in the form of rent of the price paid for
<span class='pageno' title='428' id='Page_428'></span>
permission to use the earth, as well as for the advantages
of superior soils and sites.</p>

<p>The Society, further, works for the transfer to the
community of the administration of such industrial capital
as can conveniently be managed socially. For, owing to
the monopoly of the means of production in the past,
industrial inventions and the transformation of surplus
income into capital have mainly enriched the proprietary
class, the worker being now dependent on that class for
leave to earn a living.</p>

<p>If these measures be carried out, without compensation
(though not without such relief to expropriated individuals
as may seem fit to the community), rent and interest will
be added to the reward of labour, the idle class now living
on the labour of others will necessarily disappear, and
practical equality of opportunity will be maintained by
the spontaneous action of economic forces with much less
interference with personal liberty than the present system
entails.</p>

<p>For the attainment of these ends the Fabian Society
looks to the spread of socialist opinions, and the social and
political changes consequent thereon, including the establishment
of equal citizenship for men and women. It seeks
to promote these by the general dissemination of knowledge
as to the relation between the individual and society
in its economic, ethical, and political aspects.</p>

<p>The work of the Fabian Society takes, at present, the
following forms:—</p>

<p>(1) Meetings for the discussion of questions connected
with socialism.</p>

<p>(2) The further investigation of economic problems, and
the collection of facts contributing to their elucidation.</p>

<p>(3) The issue of publications containing information on
social questions, and arguments relating to socialism.</p>

<p>(4) The promotion of socialist lectures and debates in
other societies and clubs.</p>

<p>(5) The representation of the Society in public conferences
and discussions on social questions.</p>
